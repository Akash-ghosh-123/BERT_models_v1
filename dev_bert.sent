the initial discharge and charge capacities of [UNK] are [UNK] and [UNK] g 1 , respectively , with a high coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % .
among the coated samples , the 3 wt % [UNK] sample shows a higher capacity ( [UNK] ma h g 1 ) compared to the pristine [UNK] ( [UNK] ma h g 1 ) .
the cutoff voltage was set in the voltage range of [UNK] v to [UNK] [UNK] the spec ##ic capacities were calculated based on the mass of [UNK] nanocomposites or [UNK] for [UNK] lithium batteries employing [UNK] nanocomposites or [UNK] , respectively .
during the discharge process , when the voltage fixed to [UNK] v , there emerged two new diffraction peaks at [UNK] o and [UNK] o , which could be assigned to na ##2 ##s and gas phases , respectively .
in this work , the use of [UNK] substrate implies to limit the discharge voltage to a rather high [UNK] voltage of [UNK] v in order to prevent sn ##o2 reduction to sn ##° .
as can be seen , the polycrystalline sn ##o2 nanotubes show an initial coulombic efficiency of approximately [UNK] % , which is notably higher than that of the sn ##o2 nanowires ( [UNK] % ) and powders ( [UNK] % ) [ 17 ] .
for the battery using nf @ [UNK] electrode , the initial charge voltage profiles exhibit a flat plateau at [UNK] v , which is evidently different from that of an individual z ##ab .
8 , comparing the voltage decay of ac / ac coin cells in li ##2 ##so ##4 and li ##2 ##so ##4 ##þ ##ki at ui ¼ [UNK] v and ui ¼ [UNK] v , demonstrates that s ##d is slightly reduced when implementing li ##2 ##so ##4 ##þ ##ki as electrolyte .
6a , the first discharge and charge curves of the pure co ##fe ##2 ##o ##4 electrode show voltage plateaus at about [UNK] and [UNK] v , respectively , corresponding to reduction / oxidation reactions during lithium insertion / extraction [ 10 ] .
the discharge specific capacity and discharge specific energy of the coin cell with [UNK] coated k2 ##fe ##o ##4 cathode are [UNK] ma h g 1 and [UNK] w h kg 1 respectively , which are superior to the mn ##o2 coin cell .
the wide cathodic current peak a1 around [UNK] v ( [UNK] [UNK] / li ) likely due to the partial reduction of mn ( iii ) to mn ( ii ) to form mn ##3 ##o ##4 , which was in accordance with discharge voltage platform in fig .
in the following charge process , after polarization at [UNK] v , the voltage profile shows a [UNK] between [UNK] and [UNK] v due to the [UNK] of li ##x ##ge and partial [UNK] of ge to geo ##2 .
however , the practical reversible capacities of lic ##oo ##2 products in commercial lib ##s are limited to 60 % of the theoretical value ( 274 ma ##h g−1 ) at a charging voltage of [UNK] v ( [UNK] [UNK] / li ) [ 3 ] .
[UNK] % mn ##ox + [UNK] % co ##ox / c standard ##a j = 120 ma cm−2 at voltage [UNK] v for [UNK] % mn ##ox + [UNK] % co ##ox / c and , 50 % cot ##mp ##p + 50 % ( 15 % co ##ox + 5 % mn ##ox ) 1 .
open circuit voltage of the cell was [UNK] v [UNK] li , which was higher than that with li ##2 ##s active material .
5b and c ) , the solid lim ##n2 ##o ##4 , which is prepared by a traditional [UNK] reaction with an average particle size of about 500 nm , presents a discharge capacity of only [UNK] ma h g 1 when the current density increases to 10 000 ma g 1 .
as is well known , the m ##w ##cn ##ts can not only increase the electronic conductivity but also play an important role in improving the [UNK] diffusion during the electrochemical [UNK] the electronic conductivity of the hybrid of lim ##n2 ##o ##4 and m ##w ##cn ##ts with a [UNK] network structure is [UNK] s cm 1 , which is ve orders of magnitudes larger than that of virgin ##al lim ##n2 ##o ##4 from solid state [UNK] in addition , the m ##w ##cn ##ts also decrease its crystallite size and the charge transfer resistance .
nevertheless , it is hard to achieve complete surface coating by simple ball ##mi ##ll ##ing and the electrochemical behaviors of [UNK] at a high voltage above [UNK] v are rarely reported .
the 1st and 100 ##th cycle voltage profiles of si ##o2 np ##s , si nc ##s @ si ##ox , and [UNK] nc ##s half ##cell cycled between [UNK] to [UNK] v versus li / [UNK] are plotted in fig .
for the last two compounds , very complex [UNK] profiles are reported with numerous voltage steps which contrast with the well defined and continuous [UNK] profile achieved at [UNK] v for nav ##2 ##o ##5 .
6a , there are two distinct decrease rates of the length of the discharge voltage plateau at [UNK] v from 2nd to 30 ##th cycles for the commercial li ##2 ##s and the li ##2 ##s @ c composites .
the applicable cell voltage was raised to a window between [UNK] and [UNK] v attributed to the higher li insertion / extraction potentials of life ##po ##4 .
the first charge capacity is [UNK] ma h g 1 for the li ##2 ##o2 / [UNK] electrode , much higher than that for the li ##2 ##o2 electrode ( [UNK] ma h g 1 ) .
however , the blended electrode with 5 wt % li ##2 ##o2 undergoes obvious capacity decay and only [UNK] ma h g 1 is retained after 160 cycles .
s ##3 ( [UNK] ) , li ##2 ##o2 can break down substantially in a full cell under [UNK] v and offer an additional capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 to compensate the li loss in the anode , corresponding to [UNK] % li ##2 ##o2 utilization rates .
as expected , the profiles show a relatively rapid polarisation from oc ##v to [UNK] v and from this voltage to [UNK] [UNK] due to the peculiar cv shape of life ##o2 electrode which is not rectangular shape , the charge / discharge slopes of the galvanostatic plot ( inset fig .
the voltage gap between the anodic and cathodic peaks ) are [UNK] v and [UNK] v for [UNK] , and then decrease to [UNK] v and [UNK] v for [UNK] indicating that the electrochemical kinetics of [UNK] is improved by ru ##o2 modification .
[UNK] v , which is higher than voltage plateaus of na ##xc ##oo ##2 ( average voltage ca .
the voltage plateau at around [UNK] v in the first discharge curve corresponds to the formation of li ##3 ##s ##b phase during the insertion of lithium ions .
anatase ti ##o2 nanofibers wrapped by r ##go sheets via electrospinning exhibit a high average coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % at a rate of 5 [UNK] our group synthesized a [UNK] ti ##o2 nanocomposite material through a [UNK] hydrothermal process using ti ##cl ##3 as the ti precursor .
the reduction peak of [UNK] electrode is located at [UNK] [UNK] hence , the voltage difference between the anodic and cathodic peaks of [UNK] electrode is [UNK] v , which is smaller than that of the bare lic ##opo ##4 electrode ( [UNK] v ) .
each life ##1 xm ##nx ##po ##4 sample shows two charge plateaus near [UNK] and [UNK] v , and also has two distinct discharge plateaus near [UNK] and [UNK] [UNK] but the lim ##n ##po ##4 sample only has an ind ##ist ##inc ##t discharge plateau near [UNK] v , and hardly shows a charge voltage plateau .
when charged and discharged between [UNK] and [UNK] v , the typical voltage range of a commercial [UNK] cell , the li ##2 ##mn ##o ##3 component stabilizes the electrochemically active [UNK] component and does not participate in the reaction , resulting in capacities of [UNK] 170 ma ##h g 1 .
na ##2 ##mn ##p2 ##o ##7 exhibits a discharge capacity close to 80 ma h g 1 ( at 25 c ) with a voltage of [UNK] v , the highest [UNK] / [UNK] redox potential amongst all [UNK] cathodes .
to our best knowledge , our work gives the best capacity retention of l ##co at such an extreme high voltage ( > [UNK] v ) among all of the literature , data for which is given in table 2 .
battery performance results reveal that rectangular co ##3 ##o ##4 exhibits high performance without obvious decay , especially at current densities of 500 and 1000 ma g 1 , achieving an initial discharge capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 and [UNK] ma h g 1 , respectively .
10 that in the voltage range of [UNK] v , the [UNK] [UNK] showed an exceptional discharge capacity , [UNK] ma h g 1 , in which about [UNK] % derived from the [UNK] v plateau .
as for pristine fe ##3 ##o ##4 , the discharge and charge capacities of 118 ##4 95 and 71 ##4 ma ##h [UNK] are obtained , delivering a coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % .
in addition , the specific discharge capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 remains after 500 cycles at a high current density , which indicates excellent cycl ##ability and rate capability of the asp ##rep ##ared porous pt ##h cathode .
3 ( [UNK] ) , we show the [UNK] sensing curve for the device with the mo ##o ##3 / al top electrode when the bias voltage changes from 5 v to [UNK] [UNK] we found that , even at [UNK] v ( fig .
the cyclic voltammetric ( cv ) curves of the ni ##v ##3 ##o ##8 electrode were tested over a voltage region from [UNK] to [UNK] v at a scan rate of [UNK] m ##v s 1 .
3c represents the voltage profiles of n ##h4 ##v ##4 ##o ##10 nanorods , which delivered a capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 .
for the other three carbon composite ##d mn ##o / c electrodes , in their rs ##t discharge prol ##es , all the samples presented a short steep voltage drop ranging from [UNK] to [UNK] v , as derived from the formation of an se ##i lm .
the capacity of the sheet ##like z ##ns ##no ##3 only retains [UNK] % after 100 cycles and the coulombic efficiency is about [UNK] % after 100 cycles ( fig .
however , this peak is much ##we ##aker at the cutoff voltage of [UNK] v , pointing out the low rate formation of spinel lim ##n2 ##o ##4 .
therefore , the higher cycling process cutoff voltage of [UNK] v favors the quick formation of spinel lim ##n2 ##o ##4 , leading to the decrease of the discharge voltage of ln ##cm and further to deter ##ia ##te the electrochemical performance of ln ##cm .
namely , the formation of spinel lim ##n2 ##o ##4 is much faster at the cutoff voltage of [UNK] v than at [UNK] v , resulting in the rather higher capacity at [UNK] [UNK] fig .
more significantly , the fabricated [UNK] @ [UNK] ns ##as / / [UNK] @ con ##i2 ##s ##4 np ##s asc device presents not only desired energy density of up to [UNK] wh [UNK] at [UNK] k ##w [UNK] , but also long cycle life with 85 % capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles .
moreover , life ##po ##4 has any other advantages such as its high theoretical capacity of 70 ma ##h g−1 , acceptable voltage of [UNK] v and excellent cycling er ##form ##ance .
compared with the extensively investigated life ##po ##4 , and despite having the same theoretical capacity , lic ##opo ##4 is a cathode material that promise ##s much more due to its relatively high operating voltage ( ~ [UNK] v [UNK] [UNK] / li ) .
full cells consisted of a lic ##oo ##2 cathode ( mt ##i corpor ##ation ) , a graphite anode ( mt ##i corpor ##ation ) , and [UNK] / dm ##c / dec electrolyte ; cycling was carried out at a voltage range between [UNK] and [UNK] v at [UNK] c and [UNK] c charge and discharge rates .
4 shows the initial charge / discharge curves of [UNK] electrodes before and after coating at the current density of [UNK] c rate between [UNK] and [UNK] v with constant [UNK] voltage ( [UNK] ) method .
the electrochemical properties of rep ##ared materials revealed that na ##fe ##f ##3 milled for 130 min exhibits mean discharge voltage of [UNK] v and a reversible capacity of 20 ma h g−1 in a na / [UNK] cell .
the corresponding coulombic efficiency reaches values as high as [UNK] % in case of using lib ##ob .
this may be associated with the original [UNK] electrode at a high valence , which is con ##r ##med by the [UNK] voltage of up to [UNK] v before [UNK] cycles .
among the ve compounds , [UNK] still presents the highest average cycling efficiency of [UNK] % , while the others hold the cycling coulombic efficiency of nearly [UNK] % , which further indicates the outstanding cycling performance of [UNK] .
li ##2 ##cop ##o ##4f material must be charged to high voltage ( [UNK] v ) to obtain high capacity due to its high redox potential , which results in some serious side decomposition reactions of electrolyte [ 21 ] .
li ##2 ##cop ##o ##4f / li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 full cell exhibits a voltage plateau at about [UNK] v , which leads to 78 % improvement in voltage plateau compared with life ##po ##4 / li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 full cell .
the bioc ##l samples deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 1050 ma h g 1 at two suitable discharge voltage plateaus ( [UNK] v and [UNK] v ) .
for anatase ti ##o2 , the maximum value of x for a fully reversible reaction is [UNK] , accompanied by the phase transformation from the tetragonal ti ##o2 to orthorhombic [UNK] , corresponding to a capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 .
the [UNK] composite retains a capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 at the end of 100 cycles with comparable capacity fade .
it demonstrates that the ni ##2 ##p nanosheet electrode has an initial coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % , which is slightly higher than ni ##2 ##p nanoparticles ( [UNK] % ) .
the full cell , [UNK] / lic ##oo ##2 , showed a highly reversible capacity of 162 ma ##h g - ##1 in the first cycle in the voltage range of [UNK] – [UNK] v ( figure 15 ##c ) .
in addition , ti ##of ##2 has lower [UNK] intercalation voltage ( [UNK] v ) in comparison with ti ##o2 because of the fluoride ability of the [UNK] reduction .
the rs ##t discharge capacity of the li ##3 ##vo ##4 coated sample is [UNK] ma h g 1 , which is larger than that of the pristine sample .
5 , the pp ##ear ##ance of [UNK] voltage plateaus at approximately [UNK] nd [UNK] v on the charge and discharge curves reflect the typical har ##acter ##istic ##s of olivine life ##po ##4 .
even for the introduction of 1 % mo species into ti ##o2 , the enhanced capacity of [UNK] ma h g - ##1 is achieved after 100 cycles , which is twice more than the value of ti ##o2 ( [UNK] ma h g - ##1 , 100 cycles ) .
for both cells , the first discharge proceeds through a voltage plateau , whose potential is lower for cos ##b ##3 ( [UNK] v ) than for s ##b ( [UNK] v ) , in agreement with theoretical predictions .
note that on the subsequent discharge , the s ##b / li cell still displays a plateau at [UNK] v , while for the cos ##b ##3 / li cell , the plateau evolved into a round sloping curve voltage , starting at about [UNK] v vs [UNK] / li .
also , the computational results confirm that substituting n for o lowers the voltage at which [UNK] ions are oxidised ( from [UNK] v in li ##2 ##fe ##si ##o ##4 to [UNK] v in [UNK] ) [ 44 ] .
however , the [UNK] voltage at [UNK] v is not enough to force all the lithium cations to be extracted from lim ##n ##po ##4 structure .
the presence of more electronically conductive li ##3 ##o ##4 nano particles in the primary discharge product li ##2 ##o2 tends to decrease in the charge over ##vol ##tage of the battery , explaining why the lower voltage area ( < [UNK] v ) was widely observed during the charge of the battery .
the life ##po ##4 cathode cells were cycled at c / 10 rate between [UNK] v and [UNK] [UNK] the voltage range for ti ##o2 anode cells was [UNK] [UNK] after three cycles , the cells were brought to a fully discharged state prior to the start of entropy determination .
comparing with the voltage profiles of pure graphene anode in our previous work [ 28 ] , we conclude that the difference of the discharge capacity between li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 / graphene composite and li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 below [UNK] v is mainly due to the lithium storage in the graphene sheets .
especially , for the li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 / graphene composite , more side reactions on the active graphene sheets with high specific surface area lead to low coulombic efficiency ( [UNK] % ) , which is also common in the pure graphene anode [ [UNK] ] .
when further intercalation proceeds and the voltage is below [UNK] v , a [UNK] phase is produced , [UNK] .
the cyclic voltammetric ( cv ) curves of the obtained ni ##o electrode tested over a voltage range from [UNK] to [UNK] v ( versus li / [UNK] ) at a scan rate of [UNK] m ##v s−1 are shown in fig .
moreover , a specific capacity of [UNK] ma h [UNK] can be achieved even at a rate of 1c , exhibiting a much better rate performance than that of bare lim ##n ##bo ##3 .
encapsulated sn ##o2 in carbon shell to solve the issue of fast capacity degradation , and the hollow sn ##o2 @ c nanospheres exhibited a specific capacity of [UNK] ma h g −1 at 100 ma g - ##1 over 100 cycles [ 29 ] .
the [UNK] fibers exhibit excellent cycling stability with a high reversible capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 50 ma g 1 , indicating the composite fibers could be promising anode candidates for [UNK] batteries .
the result shows that lim ##n2 ##o ##4 / sr ##li ##2 ##ti ##6 ##o ##14 full battery with a voltage plateau at [UNK] v shows excellent cycling stability and rate capability .
when the voltage discharge was stopped at [UNK] v , the na ##alg based cathode exhibited an initial capacity of 116 ##7 ma ##h g 1 and retained a capacity of 60 ##8 ma ##h g 1 after 100 cycles .
then the discharge capacity gradually decrease to ~ [UNK] ma h g - ##1 at the ~ 81 ##th cycle , but the ce of fe ##3 ##o ##4 / cu electrode increased to [UNK] % at the second cycle , and was remained between [UNK] and [UNK] % in the following cycles ( see fig .
among them , olivine l ##fp attract ##s a lot of attention , offering a theoretical capacity of 170 ma ##h g 1 and a flat voltage plateau at around [UNK] v ( [UNK] li / li ##þ ) [ 96 ##e1 ##04 ] .
the only slope voltage between [UNK] and [UNK] v in the charge curve mainly resulted from the oxidation of mn to mn ##o [ 9 ] .
figure 4 ( a ) presents the cv tests of z ##nf ##e2 ##o ##4 nanospheres for the first four cycles over a voltage range from [UNK] to [UNK] v at a scan rate of [UNK] m ##v [UNK] .
the long voltage plateau at [UNK] v is corresponding to the reduction of [UNK] and [UNK] to their metallic states , respectively , as well as the formation of li ##z ##n alloys .
electrochemical tests demonstrated that the [UNK] ba ##fe ##12 ##o ##19 nanoplates with [UNK] mol % z ##n [UNK] doping delivered a higher reversible capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 than that ( [UNK] ma h g ) of ba ##fe ##12 ##o ##19 nanoplates after 250 cycles at a current density of 100 ma g .
the [UNK] doped ti ##o2 nanoparticles also displayed a sign ##ica ##nt ##ly lower charge transfer resistance and higher reversible capacity ( [UNK] ma h g 1 aer 30 cycles ) . ##16 the [UNK] doped life ##po ##4 cathode material exhibited better [UNK] storage performance comparing with life ##po ##4 counterpart due to the expanding of lattice volume and the decrease of charge transfer [UNK] the enhanced electrochemical performances were ascribed to the improvements of electron and [UNK] conductivity by the doping of heterogeneous elements .
in comparison , the ba ##fe ##12 ##o ##19 anode shows the similar variation tendency of reversible capacity with cycling and only delivers the reversible capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 aer 250 cycles , which is much lower than that ( [UNK] ma h g 1 ) of [UNK] ba ##fe ##12 ##o ##19 nanoplates .
during charging ( so ##di ##ation ) , both electrodes show three voltage plateaus at [UNK] v , [UNK] v , and a downward slope of less than [UNK] v , corresponding to nas ##n ##5 , nas ##n , and na ##15 ##s ##n ##4 , respectively 37 .
however , only a fraction of the theoretical capacity , 130 140 ma ##h g 1 , is exploited in lic ##oo ##2 cathode of the practically used lib ##s , where [UNK] charge voltage is [UNK] v [ 3 ] .
2d , the initial discharge capacity of [UNK] composite material was [UNK] ma h g 1 and the coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % .
by comparison , the fe ##3 ##o ##4 electrode delivered only [UNK] ma h g 1 as preliminary discharge capacity , which reached maximum discharge capacities of [UNK] g h 1 with charging efficiency of about [UNK] % after 25 [UNK] cycles .
in accordance with the cv data , the nam ##no ##2 electrode showed simple [UNK] prol ##es with a short discharge voltage plateau at about [UNK] v and two tiny charge voltage plateaus at about [UNK] and [UNK] v , respectively , as shown in fig .
by contrast , the first discharge ( charge ) capacity of the cp ##n @ sn ##s2 composites was 142 ##2 ##ma ##h / g ( [UNK] / g ) and the first coulombic efficiency was [UNK] % .
however , the discharge / charge capacities of [UNK] electrode for the first cycle are 131 ##9 / 75 ##1 ma h g - ##1 with an initial coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % which is lower than that of [UNK] .
in case of [UNK] anode material , a large irreversible capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 is measured in the rs ##t cycle with an initial coulombic efficiency of about [UNK] % .
the v2 ##o ##5 [UNK] electrode exhibited an initial discharge capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 with almost no irreversible capacity loss and the final discharge capacity was retained at [UNK] ma h g 1 after 200 cycles .
2b ) , and discharge capacity remained at [UNK] ma h g−1 at 200 ma g−1 after 300 cycles , which was much higher than that of bulk ni ##3 ##v2 ##o ##8 ( [UNK] ma h g −1 ) .
when first discharging from the open circuit voltage to [UNK] v , the initial ni ##3 ##v2 ##o ##8 phase gradually turned to the ni ##o phase ( j ##cp ##d ##f card no .
4a also shows that the bare mos ##e2 electrode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 84 ##6 ma ##h g 1 and a charge capacity ( reversible capacity ) of 62 ##4 ma ##h g 1 , with a coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % .
97 ma h g 1 of n ##vp ##f after more than 120 cycles together with satisfactory coulombic efficiency ( > [UNK] % ) and very good power performance .
97 ma h g 1 of n ##vp ##f being recorded aer more than 120 cycles with high coulombic efficiency ( > [UNK] % ) .
the l ##to shows very flat operation plateau around [UNK] v ( [UNK] li ##þ / li ) , through which the growth of lithium dendrite and the se ##i film can be substantially avoided due to the higher operating voltage than the reduction potential of electrolyte solvents [ 11 ##e1 ##3 ] .
the [UNK] alloy was used as a counter electrode , because [UNK] alloy exhibits a stable voltage plateau at [UNK] v vs [UNK] / li in an [UNK] cell using a sulfide solid [UNK] the first discharge capacity of the cell using crystalline mos ##2 was approximately 270 ma ##h g - ##1 .
nb ##2 ##o ##5 microf ##low ##ers showed higher discharge capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 than the theoretical capacity of nb ##2 ##o ##5 ( 200 ma h g 1 [ 17 ] ) .
nb ##2 ##o ##5 microf ##low ##ers exhibited excellent capacity retention with average charge specific capacities of [UNK] , [UNK] , [UNK] , [UNK] , and [UNK] ma h g 1 at current densities of 20 , 40 , 100 , 200 , and 400 ma g 1 ( fig .
4a showed the cv curves of the co ##3 ##s ##4 electrodes at different reaction time 4 0 ( 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 h ) under the voltage range of [UNK] to [UNK] v at a scan rate of 2 [UNK] .
isostructural with life ##po ##4 , lim ##n ##po ##4 offers 20 % more energy density because of a voltage plateau which is [UNK] v higher than that of life ##po ##4 [ 9 ] .
more specifically , n ##vp @ [UNK] possesses an initial discharge capacity as high as [UNK] ma h g - ##1 and after 100 cycles , [UNK] ma h g - ##1 can be retained , which corresponds to [UNK] % of the initial capacity .
in order to examine the cycling behavior of the [UNK] lic ##oo ##2 materials in a wider voltage range , the charge cutoff voltage was set at [UNK] [UNK] the cycling performance of [UNK] and uncoated lic ##oo ##2 samples between [UNK] and [UNK] v is shown in fig .
in the recent years , spinel li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 ( l ##to ) has attracted great attention as an alternative anode due to its superior safety feature since its lithium insertion / extraction voltage ( [UNK] v [UNK] li ##þ / li ) is much higher than the potential needed for lithium deposition [ [UNK] ] .
9 ( b ) that the discharge voltage platform at approximately [UNK] v ( [UNK] li / [UNK] ) , which is a typical characteristic of spinel [UNK] , is quite stable and remains unchanged with cycling .
with abovementioned idea in mind , our group previously has developed a z ##n / [UNK] / life ##po ##4 system for ar ##lb , which works at an operational voltage of [UNK] v and retains capacity of 92 ma ##h [UNK] after 400 cycles .
lithium can be extracted ro ##m life ##po ##4 and inserted into fe ##po ##4 at a flat voltage potential f [UNK] v versus lithium metal .
it has been reported that there is a structural change from [UNK] to [UNK] in [UNK] when the charging voltage exceeds [UNK] v , which reduces cycle life and rate performance [ [UNK] ] .
similarly , [UNK] v2 ##o ##5 microspheres deliver a high reversible specific capacity of 292 ma h g 1 and an enhanced rate performance ( [UNK] ma h g 1 at 500 ma g 1 and [UNK] ma h g 1 at 2000 ma g 1 ) .
it an be found that a flat voltage plateau at the potential of [UNK] v , cores ##pon ##ding to the two phase insertion reaction between li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 nd li ##7 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 .
conversely , the z ##nt ##e electrode showed high reversibility with first discharge and charge capacities of 540 and 445 ma ##h [UNK] , respectively , and a high coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % .
the flat voltage plateaus between [UNK] and [UNK] v indicate the [UNK] reaction of life ##po ##4 4 fe ##po ##4 þ li ##þ þ e [ 16 ] .
undoped lim ##n2 ##o ##4 ( x ##¼ ##0 ) exhibited an initial capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 and capacity retention of [UNK] % at the end of the 100 ##th cycle .
the slow drop of potential , mainly between oc ##van ##d [UNK] v in the voltage profile exhibited an irreversible capacity of 224 ma h / g , which is larger than the cr ##s ##n2 / li cell .
trip ##lite lifes ##o ##4f is a promising cathode material [ [UNK] ] because it shows the highest operating voltage ( [UNK] v vs [UNK] / li ##0 ) * corresponding author .
the cv curves of the [UNK] electrode for the first three cycles at a scan rate of [UNK] m ##v s−1 in the voltage window between [UNK] and [UNK] v are shown in fig .
the existing li ##2 ##mn ##o ##3 can be activated when the [UNK] voltage exceed [UNK] v , resulting in extremely high capacities .
the voltage prol ##e ( 1st cycle ) of the li ##2 ##s / kb / p ##vp half cell at [UNK] ( [UNK] ma g 1 ) rate between [UNK] and [UNK] v , fig .
the specific capacity of the [UNK] ns ##s / g film shows almost no fading from [UNK] to [UNK] a g 1 , and the capacities were maintained at [UNK] and [UNK] ma h g 1 at 1 and 2 a g 1 , respectively .
the initial coulombic efficiency of [UNK] ns ##s / g ( [UNK] % ) is slightly lower than that of [UNK] ns ##s ( [UNK] % ) , but this value is higher than the [UNK] % reported for the cos ##e2 / [UNK] composite [ 31 ] .
and , the coulombic efficiency of v2 ##o ##5 nanofibers can reach as high as [UNK] % over 100 cycles , which was slightly higher than that of commercial v2 ##o ##5 ( [UNK] % ) .
the next step was the electrodeposition , carried out in [UNK] system in [UNK] m ni ##so ##4 solution with a copper fiber as cathode and a graphite rod as anode , during which the voltage of [UNK] v was applied by a [UNK] source for 20 min .
therefore , compared with [UNK] [UNK] , the [UNK] symmetric ni ##b of [UNK] ( po ##4 ) 3 exhibited higher average discharge voltage in behavior of two distinct voltage plateau ##x at [UNK] v and [UNK] v as shown in fig .
1 displays the [UNK] curves of the l ##fp half cell charged to different upper voltage limits ( from [UNK] to [UNK] v ) at c / 10 .
compared to lic ##oo ##2 and life ##po ##4 cathodes , [UNK] [UNK] cathode has some outstanding advantages of high working voltage of [UNK] v , theoretical capacity of 147 ma ##h / g , high energy density ( 650 wh / kg ) , low cost and high safety [ [UNK] ] .
1d porous fe ##2 ##o ##3 nanotubes derived from [UNK] as anodes for lib ##s exhibited an enhanced cycle performances ( [UNK] % capacity retention at 50 ##th cycle ) and rate capability ( [UNK] ma h [UNK] at 1000 ma [UNK] rate ) [ 31 ] .
9b ) , during cell charging cell voltage quickly increases over [UNK] v , while si voltage [UNK] li / [UNK] drops quickly below 400 m ##v and l ##co voltage [UNK] li / [UNK] is almost constant .
cv curves should present a reduction peak at about [UNK] v , but in fact show a very negative horizontal line at the voltage range of [UNK] v , which is also ascribed to pseudocapac ##itive behavior of ti ##o2 .
a small voltage plateau appears at around [UNK] v , corresponding to the horizontal line of cv curves at [UNK] [UNK] the sloping around [UNK] v coincides well with the reduction peaks of cv curves at [UNK] [UNK] both of them are typical pseudocapac ##itive characteristics of ti ##o2 .
the initial discharge and charge capacities of cc @ sn ##s2 are [UNK] and [UNK] ma h g 1 , respectively , with a coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % .
in the voltage slope from [UNK] to [UNK] v , within the region of [UNK] ( 0 < x < [UNK] ) , [UNK] shows a small increase in parameters a and c , and the diffraction peaks show slight shift .

in this work , the electrochemical properties of several commonly used carbon additives were investigated in a voltage range required for [UNK] [UNK] batteries ( > [UNK] v ) using high voltage spinel [UNK] as a platform .
for conventional cathodes lic ##oo ##2 and lin ##i1 / 3c ##o ##1 / 3m ##n1 / 3 ##o2 , the upper charge [UNK] voltage is lower than [UNK] v , so the negative effect from the high surface area carbons could not be obviously observed .
nc ##m , nc ##a and mixed cam composites of nc ##m and l ##co , for strain mitigation , were cycled to an upper cutoff voltage of [UNK] v [UNK] [UNK] / li .

galvanostatic charge and discharge measurements were carried out on the [UNK] sw ##agel ##ok cells in the voltage range between [UNK] and [UNK] v at different c rates ( 1 c is 148 ma g 1 for lim ##n2 ##o ##4 ) using [UNK] battery tester .
soc based ic and dv curves 118 three life ##po ##4 battery cells with the rated capacity of 60 a ##h and the permitted 119 operating voltage range from [UNK] v to [UNK] v are used to investigate the aging battery 120 ic ##a / dv ##a characteristics .
accordingly , the effective surface area for [UNK] intercalation of li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 was decreased in the voltage of [UNK] [UNK] v and increased under [UNK] v by ab .
in contrast , the cell using [UNK] had an efficiency of 93 % at 10th cycle and decreased to 80 ##th cycle , but since then , the coulombic efficiency has been maintained as [UNK] % up to 100 ##th cycle .
furthermore , the coulombic efficiency of fe ##3 ##o ##4 @ nm ##c increases to above 99 % after 10 cycles , still higher than those of nm ##c ( [UNK] % ) and fe ##3 ##o ##4 np ##s ( [UNK] % ) .
we show that the layered structure of this compound , with na ions located between the v2 ##o ##5 layers , allows the reversible insertion of 1 lithium / mole of bronze at an average voltage of [UNK] v [UNK] li ##þ / li .

for the initial charge curve , the electrode shows a slope in the voltage range between [UNK] and [UNK] v , related to the oxidation of mn to mn ##o .
the high [UNK] voltage of [UNK] v is needed to overcome the kinetic barrier , so as to electrochemically active the li ##2 ##s cathode material [ [UNK] ] .
the high [UNK] voltage at [UNK] potentials above [UNK] v may be attributed to poor contact between the sn particles and the li ##2 ##o matrix , which results in high electrochemical polarization and low electrical conductivity .
the [UNK] voltage of the co ##e ni ##es @ [UNK] [UNK] battery was measured to be [UNK] v , higher than that of pt / c þ ru ##o2 ( [UNK] v ) .
three voltage platforms are obviously presented at [UNK] v , [UNK] v and [UNK] v in the discharge process , which correspond to the lithium insertion into structural lattice of sn to form li ##xs ##n alloys with the largest [UNK] phase of li ##17 ##s ##n ##4 .

thanks to its [UNK] v high operating voltage , which is higher than [UNK] v for life ##po ##4 , [UNK] v for lic ##oo ##2 and [UNK] v for lim ##n2 ##o ##4 , the [UNK] [UNK] delivers an energy density of 650 wh kg−1 , about [UNK] % higher than the others .

herein , we introduced reduced graphene oxide aerogel ( [UNK] ) as a 3d conductive network to fe ##s2 and set [UNK] voltage to [UNK] v for avoiding the formation of polysulfide ##s ##40 .
in order to get more information about the performance of the [UNK] @ n electrodes , galvanostatic [UNK] measurements were further conducted in the voltage range between [UNK] and [UNK] v ( [UNK] ag / ag ##cl ) .
the [UNK] flexible sc device based on the mn ##o2 / ev ##a / 40 wt % cn ##t electrodes possesses fairly good electrochemical performance with a maximum energy density of [UNK] wh kg 1 ( at 67 ##80 w kg 1 ) and outstanding stability .

generally , aqueous electrolytes exhibit high conductivity ( for example , about [UNK] s cm 2 for 1 m h2 ##so ##4 at 25 c ) , which is at least one order of magnitude higher than that of organic and il electrolytes [ 248 ] .
due to the synergistic effect in the 3d i ##o ti ##o2 / pan ##i core / shell hybrid structure , the hybrid electrode gives a large specific capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 at a scan rate of 5 m ##vs 1 and exhibits excellent specific capacity retention of 73 % after 1000 cycles .
as a result , the ag / mn ##o2 nanowire electrode showed both improved electrical conductivity and increased surface area , which led to its superior supercapac ##itive performance , such as large specific capacitance ( 293 f [UNK] at a scan rate of 10 m ##v [UNK] ) , good cycle performance ( [UNK] % capacitance retention after 5000 cycles ) , and excellent rate capability ( with a specific energy and power density of [UNK] wh [UNK] and 5000 w [UNK] at 10 a [UNK] , respectively ) .

the n ##v ##mo ##p / c ( x ¼ [UNK] ) electrode still achieves a capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 aer 500 cycles , while the capacity of the pristine n ##vp electrode drops to no more than 10 ma h g 1 .
a b s t r a c t ethylene glycol bis ( prop ##ion ##itrile ) ether ( eg ##be ) is used as an electrolyte additive to improve the cycling stability and rate capability of li / [UNK] cells at high operating voltage ( [UNK] v ) .
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( ei ##s ) of the fully discharged ( [UNK] v ) li / [UNK] cells were carried out to investigate the effects of eg ##be on the interfacial impedance upon cycling at high voltage .
this results in the voltage limit for lithium de ##inter ##calation to be set at [UNK] [UNK] in order to improve the cycling efficiency of lic ##oo , at high capacities , investigations into the failure mechanisms involved at voltages greater than [UNK] v have been undertaken .

about 85 % of recorded full discharge capacity of [UNK] cells with phospho ##oli ##vin ##es synthesized with reducing agents corresponds to voltage value greater than [UNK] v versus li 0 / + and can be subs ##cribed to the [UNK] ( de ) insertion mechanism of life ##po ##4 [ [UNK] ] .
the tailored mn ##o2 nanoparticles ( np ##s ) exhibit high reversible capacity ( 109 ##5 ##ma ##h g−1 at 100 ##ma g−1 ) , high initial coulombic efficiency ( [UNK] % ) and good rate capability ( 464 ##ma ##h g−1 at 2000 ##ma g−1 ) .
the initial coulombic efficiency lower than [UNK] % suggests the conversion reaction step of sn ##o2 anode is completely irreversible , while close to 100 % is fully reversible .
the high performance of the asymmetric ec ##s could be ascrib ##e to the following factors : ( 1 ) the wide operating cell voltage ( [UNK] v ) , in which the cell voltage was extended to [UNK] v resulting in a large increase in energy density ; ( 2 ) mn ##o2 / c composites provided a porous structure with mesopores in addition to their high electrical conductivity , superior mechanical properties , and the surface area providing a fast interconnected network for the transport of electrons and [UNK] the [UNK] cycling performance of the asymmetric supercapacitor was crucial for practical applications .
a voltage plateau around [UNK] v , which is characteristic for l ##to , is prominent at every current density , which proves that l ##to is the main electrochemically active material present in the sample , thereby corrobor ##ating the interpretation of the x ##rd pattern .
we examined discharge behavior and cycl ##ability of lim ##nx ##ni ##1−x ##o2 materials at different charge [UNK] voltage ( [UNK] and [UNK] v ) as shown in fig ##s .
reported that [UNK] exhibited an improved discharge capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 at a rate of [UNK] c [ 9 ] [UNK] [UNK] provided enhancements of both electronic conductivity and electrochemical performance [ 10 ] .
the discharge capacity increases rapidly from [UNK] ma h g 1 for lim ##n ##po ##4 / c to [UNK] ma h g 1 for [UNK] / [UNK] clearly , [UNK] / c shows excellent initial discharge capacity .
further on , the l2 ##o removes from li ##2 ##mn ##o ##3 and oxygen gas is evolution when the charge voltage is beyond [UNK] v [ 8 , 9 ] .
overall , enhancing the [UNK] voltage from [UNK] v to [UNK] v is effective to enlarge the charging capacity ( [UNK] % ) of the l ##to batteries at −20 ##° ##c with slight degradation .
thus , there exists a moderate overc ##ha ##r ##ge voltage of [UNK] v at low temperature , and the ecc ##v approach can be useful to enhance low temperature charging capacity in application of large format l ##to batteries .
the ic curve of the anode has only one distinct peak at [UNK] v , representing the stable voltage plateau of the phase transition between li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 and li ##7 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 [ 9 ] , marked as [UNK] .
6 , the potential of the l ##to anode drops to [UNK] v when the cell is overc ##ha ##r ##ged to the voltage plateau which begins at [UNK] v , with similar observations that the l ##to potential may drop below 1 v when the cell is overc ##ha ##r ##ged as in ref .
when the average charging voltage ( [UNK] v [UNK] li / [UNK] ) of life ##po ##4 , in which fe acts as the redox center , is considered , the eas ##iest conclusion is that the doped [UNK] as well as [UNK] functions as an electrochemically active species during the initial [UNK] extraction .
after [UNK] with 3 wt % al ##2 ##o ##3 , the coated sample gives a higher discharge capacity ( [UNK] ma ##h g2 ##1 ) and initial coulombic efficiency ( [UNK] % ) and excellent cycl ##ability with [UNK] % capacity retention after 70 cycles .
conversely , when the iron / [UNK] om ##po ##si ##te is discharged to the cell voltage of [UNK] v , x ##rd analysis ev ##e ##als only strong peaks of fe ##3 ##o ##4 ; in addition , almost no iron is et ##ained .
lim ##n ##po ##4 is a more advantageous material than life ##po ##4 in terms of battery energy density because of its high working voltage , [UNK] v [UNK] li instead of [UNK] v and the same theoretical capacity , 170 ma ##h g 1 [ [UNK] ] .
based on the high pseudocapac ##itance of co ##3 ##o ##4 , a [UNK] battery was built and exhibited a high voltage of [UNK] v , an energy density of 241 ##wh kg 1 , and capacity retention of 80 % after 2000 cycles [ 36 ] .
among cathode materials , [UNK] spinel ( ln ##mo ) is a [UNK] choice of specific capacity comparable to that of lic ##oo ##2 , but providing a higher voltage ( [UNK] versus [UNK] v referred to the lithium electrode ) [ 2 ] .
li ##2 ##o2 + c + 1 / 2 ##o2 → li ##2 ##co ##3 ( 1 ) 2l ##i2 ##o2 + c → li ##2 ##o + li ##2 ##co ##3 ( 2 ) in o ##er , carbon will be oxidized when the voltage exceeds [UNK] v or even throughout the charge process [ [UNK] ] .
as the voltage increased to [UNK] v ( especially in those responses recorded in the presence of h2 ##so ##4 ) , the anodic current increased , indicating that some faradaic current was contributing to the total current .
the voltage plateau at around [UNK] v represented the transition from s ##8 to long chain polysulfide molecules ( li ##2 ##s ##8 , li ##2 ##s ##6 or li ##2 ##s ##4 ) , while the one at about [UNK] v reflected the further reduction of li ##2 ##s ##4 to li ##2 ##s2 and li ##2 ##s [ [UNK] ] .
when the lower [UNK] voltage during cycling is less than [UNK] v , it is known that the crystalline li ##15 ##si ##4 phase appears , from which li is can not be easily extracted [ 18 ] .
among cathode materials , [UNK] ( ln ##mo ) has been extensively studied due to its high voltage plateau ( ~ [UNK] v [UNK] li / [UNK] ) and high energy density ( ~ ##65 ##0 ##wh kg−1 ) [ 3 , 4 ] .
s1 ##3 ##a , the battery with co ##3 ##o ##4 / [UNK] hybrid materials as cathode catalyst delivers a higher open circuit voltage ( oc ##v ) of [UNK] v , which is higher than that of pt / c ( [UNK] v ) and co ##3 ##o ##4 / [UNK] ( [UNK] 200 , 300 , 400 and 500 ) .

more importantly , our assembled nico ##p nanoplates / / graphene films asymmetric supercapacitor devices can deliver a high energy density of [UNK] wh kg at a power density of 130 ##1 w kg , along with outstanding cycling performance ( 83 % capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 20 a g ) .
this voltage of [UNK] v is very high when compared to pure lic ##oo ##2 ( voltage range of [UNK] v ) ; however , in both cases the active redox couple is co ##3 ##q / co ##4 ##q .
after the first cycle , reversible voltage curves with slopes of [UNK] v [UNK] [UNK] / na are continually maintained , corresponding to reversible [UNK] storage in the na ##fe ##po ##4 olivine structure during cycling .
since per formula unit li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 can store hr ##ee li ions at a stable voltage plateau of approximately [UNK] v [UNK] i / [UNK] , its theoretical capacity is 175 ma ##h g−1 [ [UNK] ] .
the constant ##c ##urrent discharge curves show a flat voltage plateau centered at [UNK] v which is characteristic for life ##po ##4 [ [UNK] ] .
in order to evaluate the influence of [UNK] coating on the electrochemical performance of lm ##o material , the galvanostatic charge / discharge tests of pristine lm ##o and [UNK] cathodes are conducted in the voltage range of [UNK] v and [UNK] [UNK] fig .

it is found that bp can be [UNK] at [UNK] v ( [UNK] na / [UNK] ) , which protects the [UNK] / na batteries from voltage run ##away for more than 800 % overc ##ha ##r ##ge capacity by consuming the overc ##ha ##r ##ge current .

as a result , the nico ##2 ##o ##4 / sp presents a [UNK] voltage gap of [UNK] v , which is ca .
it is worth noting that the c ##b level of li ##14 ##cr ##2 ##on ##8 is only [UNK] v lower than the h2 / h2 ##o level , indicating that the bias voltage required is small .
[UNK] delivers an initial discharge capacity of [UNK] ma ##h g 1 with an initial coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % .
[ [UNK] ] however , li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 possesses low theoretical capacity ( 175 [UNK] – ##1 ) , high flat discharge voltage at [UNK] v ( [UNK] li / [UNK] ) , and low electronic conductivity ( < [UNK] [UNK] ) , which resulting in a poor charging / discharging rate capability .
at low concentrations , the open circuit voltage of [UNK] is the highest , about [UNK] v , followed by [UNK] ( [UNK] v ) .
especially , [UNK] lic ##oo ##2 showed a good cycle performance even at [UNK] v cycling because al ##po ##4 coating tp : / / [UNK] / [UNK] / [UNK] film on the surface of particles suppressed effectively co dissolution from sample into the electrolyte at higher voltage [ [UNK] ] .
after 800 cycles , the mos ##2 / [UNK] electrode can still maintain high discharge capacity of 337 ma ##h [UNK] with the retention of [UNK] % ( compared with capacity of the 20th cycle ) and high coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % .
this is slightly higher than the plateau voltage for ca ##fe ##2 ##o ##4 ( [UNK] v ) , and possibly reflects the effect of sn substitution and the counter ions ( ca , na ) and its relative ratio present in the compounds .
two obvious voltage plateaus appear at around [UNK] v and [UNK] v in the initial discharge curve , which are ascribed to [UNK] intercalation into layered mos ##2 and the subsequent conversion from mos ##2 to mo and li ##2 ##s matrix , respectively [ 13 ] .

in particular , the li / li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 batteries deliver a coulombic efficiency of > [UNK] % at the 5 c rate for 3000 cycles .
obviously , the structural stability of ti ##o2 is degraded in the low voltage ( under 1 v ) , owing to the rutile ti ##o2 happened li insertion process at [UNK] v [ [UNK] ] .
in the initial cycle of [UNK] @ mos ##2 , the first discharge and charge capacities of [UNK] @ mos ##2 electrode are 119 ##9 and 770 ma ##h g - ##1 , respectively , corresponding to a coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % ( fig .
after voltage plateau , the curve of discharge ( below [UNK] v ) plays a primary part in the total capacity contribution rate that can be ascribed to the reversible surface / interface storage on the c @ ti ##o2 nanocomposites .
the galvanostatic [UNK] tests of the [UNK] / sn ##o2 / carbon nanocomposites were performed at a current density of 100 ##ma g−1 with a voltage range between [UNK] and [UNK] v ( fig .
the maximum efficiency for this hierarchically porous ti ##o2 structure is [UNK] % with 50 nm pores and a 6 mm thickness , where the [UNK] voltage ( vo ##c ) and the fill factor ( ff ) are [UNK] v and [UNK] , respectively .
to address these requirements , great efforts have been made to develop [UNK] cathodes because the strongly covalent ( po ##4 ) 3 units provide greater structural stability than commercial lic ##oo ##2 hosts even under deep charging conditions and elevated [UNK] among the known phosphates , monoclinic li ##3 ##v2 ( po ##4 ) 3 ( l ##vp ) is a promising lib cathode because of its higher operating voltage ( [UNK] v ) and its ability to deliver a capacity of 197 ma h g 1 as 3 [UNK] are inserted / extracted in the operating voltage range of [UNK] [UNK] however , monoclinic l ##vp suffers from low electrical conductivity ( [UNK] 10 8 s cm 1 ) ; hence , achieving its full theoretical capacity and a high rate performance is challenging .
intensive attention ##s had been focused on the life ##po ##4 because of low cost , excellent ab ##use tolerance , a reversible specific capacity of 170 ##ma ##h g 1 , a flat charge / discharge profile at intermediate voltage ( [UNK] v [UNK] li ##þ / li ) and reasonable cycle life [ [UNK] ] .
in the voltage range of [UNK] v , [UNK] electrode presents the largest initial discharge capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 at [UNK] a g .
but the energy density of ru ##o2 decreases rapidly to [UNK] wh kg 1 ( at 5000 w kg 1 ) when the power density is more than 1000 w kg 1 .
in sharp contrast , the graphene / ru ##o2 composite still retains a high energy density of [UNK] wh kg 1 at 5000 w kg 1 and [UNK] wh kg 1 at a power density as high as he ##ne / ru ##o2 composite ( ro ##gs ##cs ) ec ##s .
spinel li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 has a relatively high lithiation voltage plateau at [UNK] v [UNK] [UNK] / li , which avoids lithium plating and the formation of the insulating [UNK] interface ( se ##i ) ; hence it is very safe [ 12 ] .
[ 11 ] reported the electrochemical performance of layered [UNK] exhibiting an average voltage of [UNK] v [UNK] na / na ##þ in 1m na ##cl ##o ##4 in propylene carbonate ( pc ) as electrolytic solution .
/ electroc ##hi ##m a ##yer was known to stabilize the structure of lic ##oo ##2 dur ##ng cycling at voltage over [UNK] v with a reasonable [UNK] ion on ##duc ##tivity .
later , a sloping curve from [UNK] v down to the cutoff voltage of [UNK] [UNK] it is worth noting that the fe ##3 ##o ##4 / c presents large voltage hysteresis between the discharge and charge plateau ( [UNK] v ) .
nevertheless , li ##2 ##mn ##o ##3 is electrochemically inactive in the normal voltage range ( < [UNK] v [UNK] li ##þ / li ) of [UNK] battery because all mn atoms in li ##2 ##mn ##o ##3 are in þ ##4 valence .
nevertheless , all composites have much higher discharge capacities than the pristine li ##2 ##mn ##o ##3 at different current densities under both [UNK] and [UNK] v [UNK] voltage .
in the [UNK] curves , both of them exhibit voltage plateaus at [UNK] v , subsequently declines to cutoff voltages of [UNK] v gradually , indicating typical characteristics of voltage prol ##es trends for co ##3 ##o ##4 anode .
in general , the discharging and charging voltage plateaus mainly appear at [UNK] v and [UNK] v [UNK] [UNK] / li , which correspond to the reversible conversion reaction of li and ni ##3 ##s2 .
the long voltage tail at below [UNK] v in the discharge process can be ascribed to the deep conversion reaction of partially lithiated [UNK] the [UNK] composites do not have clear voltage plateaus associated with the mo ##o2 phase possibly because of the contribution of the carbon phase .

for further investigate the effect of different coating materials on electrochemical properties of liv ##po ##4f , the discharge curves of four composites at different rates with the voltage range from [UNK] to [UNK] v at 25 ##℃ are presented in fig .
therefore , it can be inferred that the pure v2 ##o ##5 processes relatively poorer reversibility for li intercalation with the voltage plateau of about [UNK] v ( 3 / d transition ) , which is considered a main reason for the fast capacity fading .
life ##po ##4 has a high lithium intercalation voltage ( [UNK] v relative to lithium metal ) , high theoretical capacity ( 170 ma ##h / g ) , ease of synthesis and stability when used with common organic electrolyte systems [ 211 ] .

on the other hand , fe ##2 ##o ##3 has no contribute to capacity because the discharge platform of fe ##2 ##o ##3 is not higher than 2 v [ [UNK] ] , resulting in decreasing of capacity in the voltage region from 2 v to [UNK] v , as shown in fig .

after 50 cycles at 1000 ma g , nico ##mn ##o ##4 @ graphene delivers a reversible capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 while the pristine nico ##mn ##o ##4 only has a capacity of [UNK] ma h g .
for example , [UNK] mg ##fe ##si ##o ##4 exhibited a high reversible capacity exceeding 300 ma h g 1 at a voltage of approximately [UNK] v [UNK] mg [ 12 ] .
[UNK] the initial coulombic efficiency is [UNK] % for sn ##o2 @ [UNK] and [UNK] % for [UNK] .

2b ) , two ##ste ##p voltage plateaus at [UNK] and [UNK] v appeared , arising from the structural changes of na ##fe ##o2 from the hexagonal phase to the monoclinic phase that occurs after the removal of [UNK] mol of na and further na removal from the monoclinic phase , respectively fig .
moreover , the cell with the [UNK] / [UNK] catalyst presented much lower voltage polarization ( about [UNK] v at a rate of 50 ma g - ##1 ) than that measured with only mn ##o2 nanorods during charge / discharge processes .
typical reversible delithiation for lic ##oo ##2 in commercial lithium batteries is only [UNK] ma ##h g 1 with a charging voltage [UNK] limit of [UNK] v , which only corresponds to 50 % utilization of its theoretic capacity .
li ##3 ##fe ##f ##6 , used as a cathode material for [UNK] batteries ( lib ##s ) , exhibited a reversible specific capacity of 100 ma h g 1 at an average voltage of [UNK] v , which is expected for the fe ##3 ##þ / fe ##2 ##þ redox couple [ 4 ] .
the main drawbacks of lic ##oo ##2 include a relatively high cost of co and a low stability when it is charged at high voltage ( up to [UNK] v ) leading to appreciable capacity fading [ 1 ] .
remarkably , a retention capacity of mn ##f2 is [UNK] ma ##h g−1 and an outstanding coulombic efficiency attains to [UNK] % at 1 c after 250 cycles .
for the commercial li ##2 ##s electrode , at the beginning of the first charge the amount of voltage immediately reached to [UNK] v which was in accordance with its corresponding value in the first anodic peak in cyclic voltammetry measurement .
however , a fraction of cos ##e still exists in the host material without involving in the conversion reaction , owing to the relatively high [UNK] voltage ( [UNK] v ) .
the specific power values are observed to increases from 1 to [UNK] k ##w kg - ##1 , while the specific energy of nico ##2 ##o ##4 thin film increases from [UNK] to [UNK] wh kg - ##1 for sample deposited at 300 to 350 0 c , respectively .

the rs ##t slope begins from the open voltage ( [UNK] v ) to [UNK] v and may originate from the reduction of mn ##3 ##o ##4 to the intermediate composite manganese oxide phase .
many fe ##3 ##o ##4 particles formed in the cells cycled with [UNK] v as a [UNK] voltage ( figure 9a , d ) are porous .
however , the specific energy of if ##ep ##o ##4 is still lower compared with the conventional lib ( lithium ##on battery ) using lic ##oo ##2 and lim ##n2 ##o ##4 because of the low relative ed ##ox voltage of [UNK] v versus li / [UNK] .

the cell voltage can be expressed as the sum of the potential ranges of mn ##o2 and graphene electrodes , and consequently , the mn ##o2 and graphene electrodes exhibit potential for constructing high voltage asymmetric supercapacitor working at [UNK] v with 1 m na ##2 ##so ##4 aqueous electrolyte .
the mn ##o2 / graphene asymmetric cell exhibits an energy density of [UNK] wh kg 1 at a power density of 100 w kg 1 , and maintains [UNK] wh kg 1 at a power density of 2500 w kg 1 .
furthermore , the energy density of the mn ##o2 / graphene asymmetric cell is much higher than that of the symmetric mn ##o2 / mn ##o2 ( [UNK] wh kg 1 ) cell or the graphene / graphene ( [UNK] wh kg 1 ) cell at the same power density .
the [UNK] mn ##o2 / graphene asymmetric supercapacitor could operate reversibly at a high cell voltage up to [UNK] v , and exhibits a specific capacitance of 37 f g 1 at a discharge current density of 5 ma cm 2 .
however , the low voltage plateau of life ##po ##4 ( [UNK] v [UNK] [UNK] / li ) limits the energy density and prevents it from wider acceptance for vehicle application .
the nominal voltage for both nic ##d and ni ##mh batteries is [UNK] [UNK] in both cases three cells are usually connected in series to boost the nominal voltage to [UNK] v , which is comparable to the [UNK] v nominal voltage of standard [UNK] batteries .
as anodes for lib ##s , mn ##o exhibits a higher capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 after 400 cycles ( [UNK] ma h g 1 for mn ##o2 after 300 cycles ) at 2000 ma g 1 .

it has been commercial ##ized in primary lib ##s as early as the 1980s ##24 and later extensively investigated in secondary [UNK] however , pyrite fe ##s2 as an electrode material of room temperature rechargeable si ##bs shows poor electrochemical performance owing to its poor conductivity , large volume changes and sluggish kinetics during the charge / discharge [UNK] to enhance the electrochemical performance of pyrite fe ##s2 , various strategies have been proposed , such as compos ##iting with conductive carbon [UNK] [UNK] utilizing quasi [UNK] [UNK] and optimizing the electrochemical [UNK] for example , fe ##s2 microspheres were reported to exhibit a [UNK] capability and [UNK] cycl ##ability in si ##bs by precisely controlling the intercalation reaction through simultaneously tuning the terminate voltage to [UNK] v and selecting a compatible [UNK] [UNK] more recently , a facile [UNK] method has been developed by lo ##u ’ s group to prepare fe ##s2 @ c [UNK] nanob ##ox ##es , which deliver excellent sodium storage [UNK] despite this encouraging progress , structural tailoring and facile controllable preparation of [UNK] nanocomposites to further improve the [UNK] performance in terms of rate capacity and cycling stability are still required toward meeting the needs of the practical application of pyrite materials .
consistent with the cv results , only one voltage plateau located at [UNK] v can be well observed in the first discharge process , which is mainly attributed to the formation of na ##x ##fe ##s2 ( 0 < x ≤ 2 ) by the insertion of sodium into pristine fe ##s2 .
the first charge and dish ##arge capacities of the uncoated cathode are 117 and [UNK] ma ##h −1 , respectively , showing a coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % , while ho ##se of lim ##n2 ##o ##4 @ v2 ##o ##5 are [UNK] and [UNK] ma ##h g−1 , respectively , he coulombic efficiency is [UNK] % .
it also shows typical discharge and charge behavior of the spinel li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 with potential plateaus at [UNK] v during discharge and [UNK] v during charge , and implies that the introduction of cu does not change the electrochemical reaction process of li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 in this voltage range [ 4 ] .
spinel li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 has a flat and relatively high lithiation voltage plateau at about [UNK] v versus li / li ##þ , which is very important property of the electrode material for long term high voltage in practical use .
it is evident to conclude that cu op ##ed lic ##oo ##2 materials synthesized by this method deliver sup ##ei ##or stable capacities at high voltage ( [UNK] v ) over the pristine lic ##oo ##2 at ##ho ##de materials .

compared with other intercalation electrodes , it intercal ##ates li ions at a voltage mainly between [UNK] and [UNK] v versus li ##þ / li , lower than that of li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 and higher than the dendrite formation voltages .
because of the stabilization of amorphous carbon framework , the coulombic efficiency of sn ##o2 @ c electrode maintains above [UNK] % except the first cycle ( initial coulombic efficiency is [UNK] % ) .

galvanostatic discharge profile of cu ##co ##2 ##s ##4 / c composite electrode recorded at c / 5 rate in the voltage range [UNK] - [UNK] v reveals that the initial discharge capacity is 262 ma ##h [UNK] , corresponding to [UNK] insertion per [UNK] .
for example , [UNK] [UNK] sample exhibits voltage differences of [UNK] v at [UNK] and [UNK] v at [UNK] , whereas [UNK] shows [UNK] v at [UNK] and [UNK] v at [UNK] .

this is slightly higher than the plateau voltage for ca ##fe ##2 ##o ##4 ( [UNK] v ) , and possibly reflects the effect of sn substitution and the counter ions ( ca , na ) and its relative ratio present in the compounds .
besides , there are mainly another two voltage plateaus at about [UNK] v and [UNK] v respectively in the first discharge of the 3d porous mn ##3 ##o ##4 nas electrode .

7c , d ) also shows that the superior capacity of mn ##2 ##s ##no ##4 @ c over mn ##o / sn ##o2 @ c mainly comes from the voltage region above [UNK] v , which is relative to the reversible transformation from sn ##o2 to sn .
in addition , the coulombic efficiency of [UNK] symmetric supercapacitor is [UNK] % .
the first discharge and charge capacities of z ##n2 ##ge ##o ##4 were 216 ##1 and 113 ##5 ma h [UNK] , respectively , with a coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % .

considering that the charge [UNK] voltage is [UNK] v , this [UNK] characteristic is excellent compared with that of the om ##mer ##ci ##ali ##zed cathode material , lic ##oo ##2 , where ∼5 ##4 % capac ##ty retention after 50 cycles ( between [UNK] and [UNK] v at 1 c ) was bs ##erved [ 30 ] .
nevertheless , li ##2 ##mn ##o ##3 is electrochemically inactive in the normal voltage range ( < [UNK] v [UNK] li ##þ / li ) of [UNK] battery because all mn atoms in li ##2 ##mn ##o ##3 are in þ ##4 valence .
4a , the initial charge / discharge profiles of the li ##2 ##mn ##o ##3 electrode at a [UNK] v [UNK] voltage are similar to the previous reports [ [UNK] ] .

therefore , it can be inferred that the pure v2 ##o ##5 processes relatively poorer reversibility for li intercalation with the voltage plateau of about [UNK] v ( 3 / d transition ) , which is considered a main reason for the fast capacity fading .
among those materials , na ##fe ##f ##3 had a relatively a large discharge capacity ( 128 ma h g 1 ) with an average cell voltage of [UNK] v ( fig .
