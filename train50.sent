The Fe2O3 / 3DGN composite demonstrated an impressive capacity of 864 mA h g 1 in the 50th cycle , which was extremely superior to pure Fe2O3 ( 24.3 mA h g 1 ) , benefiting from the excellent electrical conductivity of 3DGN ( Fig .
The b-LiVOPO4 / LaPO4 samples delivered an initial discharge capacity of about 127.0 mA h g 1 at 0.1 C and possessed favorable capacities at rates of 0.5 and 1 C. Therefore , surface modification of crystalline LaPO4 is an effective way to improve the electrochemical performance of bLiVOPO4 .
During the first discharge , the voltage profile shows a voltage plateau at around 1.1 V , which is consistent with the earlier CV profiles arising from the irreversible SnO2 reduction and SEI formation .
Note that the C-coated hollow SnO2 array electrode shows a considerably higher initial coulombic efficiency ( 58.8 % ) than the pristine hollow SnO2 ( 52.4 % ) and SnO2 nanopowders ( 33.0 % ) ( Table S1 of the ESI { ) .

This technique allows the initial coulombic efficiency as high as 94.9 % without sacrificing the structural stability of SiOx at all throughout cycling .
By limiting the upper cutoff voltage to 1.0 V instead of 1.5 V with the same 0.2 C rate , the SnO2 NP electrode can maintain a capacity of 500 mAh g 1 up to 50 cycles ( Fig .
We believe this implies that even when the upper cutoff voltage is limited to 1.0 V , the decomposition of Li2O is inhibited but not prevented , which may explain the delayed onset of capacity fading for the SnO2 NP electrode .

The large initial irreversible capacity is mainly related to the side reactions that occur at the voltage around 1.5 V to form the SEI film , and to the irreversible reaction of Li ions and sulfur to form Li2S .
Another possible way is to widen the voltage window , because when the voltage was increased to 2.0 V , the Li2S would decompose and the irreversible reaction between Li and S would become partially reversible [ 20 ] .
When the calcinations time is 20 h , 30 h and 40 h , the discharge capacity of LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 electrode is 85.25 mAh g 1 , 105.21 mAh g 1 and 77.46 mAh g 1 , and coulombic efficiency is 65.0 % , 67.44 % and 73.6 % .

7 , it can be seen that Li4Ti5O12 shows a gradual loss of the 1.55 V plateau with increasing the cycling number at low-rate charge–discharge ( 0.1 C ) , and this may be due to the low discharge voltage ( discharged to 0 V ) .
During discharge , solid PbO / PbOx is converted to Pb2+ ions at 1.8 V first , before PbO2 is at 2.0 V. This creates the two discharge voltage levels .
The voltage of the cell hen decreases from 0.5 V and slowly down to 0 V. This is similar to the first charge–discharge curve of GeO2 compounds [ 30 ] .

In addition , the rate of ammonia synthesis increased as the applied voltage increased to 2.0 V , and the maximum rate was achieved using RuO2 / PANI / N-MWCNT .
The disadvantage of the battery is the relatively low output voltage of 0.3 V for a single exible battery that is much lower than the theoretical value of 1.8 V using a LiFePO4 cathode and a Li4Ti5O12 anode .
Obviously , the larger energy density of LiMn0.8Fe0.2PO4 / C mainly comes from the higher average discharge voltage ( w 4 V ) , about 0.6 V higher than that of LiFePO4 / C .
Among them , LiMnPO4 was widely investigated due to promising electrochemical features , such as a specific capacity comparable to LiFePO4 and working voltage of 4.1 V vs. Liþ / Li , and a higher theoretical energy density ( 700Wh kg 1 ) [ 17 ] .
