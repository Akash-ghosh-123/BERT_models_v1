rechargeable lithium ion batteries ( lib ##s ) have long been considered to be one of the most promising energy storage systems because of the higher energy density , higher rate , higher stability , longer cycle life , and improved safety than competing [UNK] currently commercial lib usually uses graphite as anode , but a stable solid electrolyte interface ( se ##i ) lm formed on the surface of graphite / carbon particles and volume expansion / contraction during [UNK] intercalation / extraction could possibly cause serious safety [UNK] therefore , it is highly desired to explore new anode materials with high safety and excellent cycl ##ability instead of uns ##af ##e carbon [UNK] as one of the most excellent lithium ion battery anode materials , li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 has been extensively studied , owing to its particular advantages of low toxicity , low cost , easy preparation and [UNK] lithium intercalation / [UNK] furthermore , it possesses a at voltage plateau at approximate [UNK] v ( [UNK] [UNK] / li ) , which is higher than the reduction potential of most organic electrolytes , thus avoiding the formation of a [UNK] interface ( se ##i ) . ##6 nevertheless , the high rate performance of li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 is hindered by inherently poor electronic conductivity , which has been a main ring , chang ##zhou university , chang ##zhou n ne ##ering , h ##una ##n university of art ##s and ai ##l : h ##x ##b2 ##20 ##17 ##0 @ [UNK] ; tel : + ##86 ab ##ora ##tor ##y of si ##ch ##uan province , zig ##ong ring , central south university , chang ##sh ##a 00 obstacle to its [UNK] several strategies have been proposed to solve this issue , including synthesizing the nanosized particles via various [UNK] and surface mod ##ication by means of conductive matters ( au , ag , cu , carbon , etc .
in order to improve the discharge capacity of lic ##oo ##2 , an pp ##er cutoff voltage above [UNK] v must be applied to extract more [UNK] in lic ##oo ##2 , but this causes severe capacity fading .

the intrinsic electrochemical window for the li ##6 ##ps ##5 ##cl composition corresponds to a range of voltage ( [UNK] v ) , while the width of electrochemical window is between [UNK] and [UNK] v for li ##6 ##pt ##es ##4 ##cl .
hence , they can improve the cycling stability and performance of lic ##oo ##2 when cycled at high voltage ( [UNK] v [UNK] li / [UNK] ) .
upon altering the current density back to 100 ma g - ##1 , an average capacity of pure fe ##3 ##o ##4 was [UNK] ma h g - ##1 , which is also lower than fe ##3 ##o ##4 / cu anode ( [UNK] ma h g - ##1 ) .

it can be found that the [UNK] ba ##fe ##12 ##o ##19 anode delivers the reversible capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 aer 250 cycles at the current density of 100 ma g 1 .

the two obvious voltage plateaus present at [UNK] and [UNK] v in the first cycle are ascribed to the irreversible reactions between fe ##4 ##n and [UNK] ions accompanying with the formation of se ##i layer .

the [UNK] delivers an initial discharge capacity and charge capacity of 213 ##8 ma ##h g−1 and 118 ##0 ma ##h g−1 , respectively , with a corresponding initial coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % .
due to the superior specific capacitance values and high voltage window ( [UNK] v ) , energy density values of the asymmetric supercapacitors are also very high ( [UNK] wh [UNK] for co ##3 ##o ##4 / / ac and [UNK] wh [UNK] for co ##3 ##v2 ##o ##8 / / ac ) .
it can be seen that the initial charge and discharge capacity of the sn ##o2 spheres at a current density of [UNK] are [UNK] ma ##h / g and [UNK] ma ##h / g , respectively with an initial coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % .
the oxidation / reduction peak in the voltage around [UNK] v should be considered to be the overlap of two oxidized / reduced peaks , which was ascribed to the [UNK] structure of the v2 ##o ##5 [ 50 ] .
[ 96 ] increased the specific capacity of the mos ##2 by controlling the [UNK] voltage until [UNK] v vs na / na ##þ during the so ##di ##ation process , but that caused a peeling off of the mos ##2 layers [ 96 ] , producing more available sites for [UNK] host ##ing .

based on this , we ascribed the deep blue colour to instability of mo ##2 ##c at high voltage in place of the formation of li ##x ##mo ##o ##3 , and ascertained that the charge voltage should be limited below [UNK] v to avoid the reaction of mo ##2 ##c .

on starting the charge process , the voltage of the el ##l suddenly increased to [UNK] v and then slowly increased p to [UNK] v , which is similar to the voltage profile of lic ##oo ##2 .
for instance , [UNK] delivers the discharge capacity of [UNK] [UNK] in the first cycle at [UNK] with the capacity retention of [UNK] % , and initial operating voltage of [UNK] v with the voltage drop of [UNK] v after 100 cycles .
at the rs ##t discharge process , voltage plateau appears at [UNK] v , which is owing to the reaction between li and geo ##2 .
the capacity of the hollow co ##3 ##o ##4 microb ##ers reaches [UNK] ma h g 1 at 100 ma g 1 , with high initial coulombic efficiency ( [UNK] % ) and cycling stability ( [UNK] % capacity retention for 200 cycles ) .
the working voltage of pine ##l li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 is approximately at [UNK] v ( [UNK] li / [UNK] ) , which avoids he formation of a conventional solid electrolyte interphase ( [UNK] .
5c ) exhibited a long voltage plateau at [UNK] v and [UNK] v in the first discharge , respectively , which might be ascribed to the transformation of co ##3 ##o ##4 nanocomposites into co and li ##2 ##o .
the high initial coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % is superior to the most of hybrid nanocomposites of co ##3 ##o ##4 and carbon materials ( table 1 ) .
from table 1 , we could see that the [UNK] hp ##cc ( 60 ##m ##g ) nanocomposites delivered higher coulombic efficiency ( [UNK] % ) and reversible capacity and better cycling performance ( 121 ##5 ma h g 1 after 100 cycles ) than most of other [UNK] materials .
the [UNK] hp ##cc ( 60 ##m ##g ) nanocomposites delivered good specific capacity of 121 ##5 ma h g 1 after 100 cycle and high initial coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % .
moreover , rc ##t changed only slightly with discharge / charge voltages of [UNK] [UNK] however , for a voltage of sr ##li ##2 ##ti ##6 ##o ##14 / li cell lower than [UNK] v , rc ##t increased with increasing li ##þ insertion into the sr ##li ##2 ##ti ##6 ##o ##14 lattice and the lattice volume increased at a faster rate than at other voltages .
upon voltage range between [UNK] and [UNK] v , si ##ox / sn ##ws @ c exhibits reversible capacity ~ ##12 ##80 ##ma ##h g 1 ( [UNK] cm 2 seen in fig .
compared with the general graphitic carbons , li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 has a flat and relatively high voltage plateau at approximately [UNK] v versus [UNK] / li , thus the formation of the solid electrolyte interface ( se ##i ) layers and electroplating of lithium is avoiding .
this is because l ##to has [UNK] cycle ##ability , high flat discharge voltage at [UNK] v ( [UNK] li / [UNK] ) , high reversible capacity , and good safety [ 1 ] .
lic ##oo ##2 is usually cyl ##ed to an upper [UNK] voltage of [UNK] v versus li and iv ##es a specific capacity of ∼14 ##0 ma ##h g−1 .
1 shows the cv of l ##to sample in the rs ##t few cycles in the voltage range of [UNK] [UNK] all cv curves exhibited similar redox peaks around at [UNK] v and [UNK] v , which were attributed to the redox of [UNK] / [UNK] .
and the voltage plateau at [UNK] v is due to the conversion reaction from fem ##o ##4 ##s ##6 to fe , mo , and li ##2 ##s .
in the 1st cycle , fem ##o ##4 ##s ##6 delivers a discharge capacity of 973 ma h g 1 and charge capacity of 74 ##9 ma h g 1 , with a coulombic efficiency ( ce ) of [UNK] % .
as seen , it shows an initial discharge capacity of [UNK] ma h g - ##1 with the coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % based on the mass of z ##ns ##b2 ##o ##6 during the first cycle .
in the positive voltage sweep , an anodic peak occurs at [UNK] and [UNK] v for z ##no and ta ##2 ##o ##5 film electrodes , respectively .
8 ( c ) , two distinct potential plateaus at about [UNK] and [UNK] v are observed in the first cycle , which are typical characteristics of voltage trends for fe ##2 ##o ##3 materials ( fe ##2 ##o ##3 + [UNK] [UNK] = 2f ##e + 3 ##li ##2 ##o ) [ 33 ] .
during the whole cycling process at 12 a g - ##1 , the average coulombic efficiency from the 3 r ##d to 600 th cycles of com ##n2 ##o ##4 / c was as high as [UNK] % ( figure 3d ) , confirming a good reversibility from another angle .
the high capacity of lithium ##rich layered oxide cathode materials can not be achieved until they are charged to an upper [UNK] voltage of above [UNK] v in order to activate li ##2 ##mn ##o ##3 component .
alternative cathodes such as lim ##n2 ##o ##4 or life ##po ##4 yield cell potentials of [UNK] v and [UNK] v , respectively , and somewhat ( 15 % ) reduced energy densities due to lower specific capacity and lower voltage , respectively .
the onset discharge voltage is about [UNK] v for li ##2 ##vo ##3 , which is lower than that of about 4 v for li ##2 ##vo ##2 ##f .
the initial coulombic efficiency ( ice ) was around [UNK] % and [UNK] % for the na ##cl ##o ##4 and nap ##f ##6 containing [UNK] electrolytes without additive .
the pure mos ##2 delivers very fast capacity fading and has a very low ##ing charge capacity of [UNK] ma h [UNK] after the 100 ##th cycle .
with the amount of the mos ##2 ( 47 [UNK] % ) and ti ##o2 ( 53 [UNK] % ) counted in , the calculated capacity of 3d [UNK] @ ti ##o2 is [UNK] ma h g - 1 .
because lin ##o ##3 may be irreversibly reduced on the cathode at potentials lower than [UNK] v ( [UNK] li / li ##þ ) , the discharge cutoff voltage here was set at [UNK] v to avoid capacity fade due to reduction of the nitrate [ [UNK] ] .
all the cells exhibited discharge voltage plateaus around [UNK] v , which is the main characteristic of the [UNK] reaction of the lithium extraction and insertion between life ##po ##4 and fe ##po ##4 .
4b shows the first charge / discharge curve of mn ##co ##2 ##o ##4 an ##ow ##ire array in a voltage range of 0 ##− [UNK] v at a current den ##ity of 1 a g−1 .
among these compounds , lim ##n ##po ##4 cathode material is now admitted as one of the most promising candidate for advanced batteries , because of its higher operating voltage ( [UNK] v [UNK] [UNK] / li ) compare to life ##po ##4 ( [UNK] v [UNK] [UNK] / li ) .
moreover , owing to the introduction of anatase ti ##o2 , the li + charge / discharge process at a higher potential of around [UNK] v ( [UNK] li / [UNK] ) was also favorable for the enhancement of the capacity of l ##to composites and their applied voltage range .
[UNK] composites were cycled from [UNK] to 20 ##c over different voltage ranges , that is , from [UNK] v to [UNK] , [UNK] , and 0 [UNK] the corresponding rate cycling performance and charge / fig .

the initial discharge / charge capacities of [UNK] , [UNK] and pure co ##3 ##o ##4 electrode are 182 ##8 / 137 ##1 , 153 ##0 / 113 ##9 and 114 ##5 / 900 ma ##h g - ##1 , corresponding to coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % , [UNK] % and [UNK] % , respectively .
other olivine structures include lim ##n ##po ##4 ( lm ##p ) which offers [UNK] v higher average voltage compared to olivine l ##fp ( table 1 ) , leading to higher specific energy , but at the expense of lower conductivity [ 104 ] .

[UNK] [UNK] the transition metal oxides , ru ##ox has been the most extensively studied candidate due to its wide potential window , highly reversible redox reactions , three distinct oxidation states accessible within a [UNK] v voltage window , high proton conductivity , remarkably high specific capacitance , good thermal stability , long cycle life , metallic ##ty ##pe conductivity , and high rate [UNK] with ru ##o2 electrodes , [UNK] charging only contributes to about 10 % of the accumulated charge , in parallel with which the redox pseudocapac ##itance mechanism can occur .
in contrast , the sn ##o2 / [UNK] can deliver a capacity of 168 ##0 ##ma ##h g 1 at the first discharge with the coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % .
the coulombic efficiency in the initial cycle was low for both the uncoated ( [UNK] % ) and the coated ( [UNK] % ) sample due to irreversible side reactions , including the electrolyte decomposition ( se ##i formation ) and sn ##ox conversion to sn and li ##2 ##o .

prepared a [UNK] using nanostructured li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 ( l ##to ) as the negative material and activated carbon ( ac ) as the positive material showing an energy density of 20 w h kg−1 that was larger than those of conventional [UNK] in addition , various [UNK] composed of l ##to anodes and carbon cathodes such as graphene , nanotubes , and activated carbon ( ac ) have been prepared to have promising energy storage [UNK] however , the energy density of [UNK] comprising l ##to anodes is limited by the relatively high [UNK] insertion / desert ##ion potential ( > [UNK] v ) and low specific capacity ( ∼17 ##5 ma h g−1 ) of [UNK] moreover , the low [UNK] diffusion coefficient and poor electron conductivity of l ##to hamp ##er the rate performance and power density of [UNK] transition metal oxides ( tm ##os ) such as nb ##2 ##o ##5 [UNK] and mn ##o2 [UNK] are promising anode materials in [UNK] due to their large theoretical specific capacity and relatively low voltage plateau .
as compared with the reversible capacity of 54 ##7 ma h [UNK] of [UNK] fe ##3 ##o ##4 / c originated from pure p ##b , the hp ##hn ##f could deliver a good capacity of [UNK] ma h [UNK] at a specific current of 200 ma [UNK] even after 200 cycles due to the [UNK] carbon network possess improved electrical conductivity and novel interior hierarchical porous hollow structure which are able to relie ##ve the volume change during the discharge / charge processes and enhance the transfer of [UNK] .

in this communication , it is shown that capacity fading of lic ##oo ##2 cathode material during cycling with a charge [UNK] voltage of [UNK] v is correlated with a [UNK] distribution of local strain induced by repeating lithiation / [UNK] and co dissolution .

first they quickly drop from the [UNK] voltage to [UNK] v , which could be attributed to the lithium insertion in [UNK] to [UNK] and the transformation from [UNK] to cubic li ##x ##fe ##2 ##o ##3 .

the discharge voltage is around [UNK] v at [UNK] [UNK] the plateaus around [UNK] v are ascribed to the [UNK] [UNK] transitions between life ##po ##4 and fe ##po ##4 [ 21 ] .
the distinct voltage plateau at approximately [UNK] v is primarily ascribed to the lithiation reaction of s ##b with li ##þ to form li ##3 ##s ##b , as is evident from the 2nd , 20th , and 50 ##th cycles ; this phenomenon is typical for s ##b anodes [ [UNK] ] .
the theoretical energy density of the li / fe ##s2 couple , based on [UNK] e / fe ##s2 and on an average voltage of [UNK] v , is close to 860 wh / kg , which is almost twice that of the li / lic ##oo ##2 cell .

the first discharge curve shows a continuous voltage decrease from the open circuit voltage to [UNK] v with [UNK] mol [UNK] intercal ##ating during a [UNK] reaction , which can be ascribed to the formation of li ##x ##fe ##3 ##o ##4 [ 9 ] .
interestingly , the graphite / [UNK] full cell cycled in the [UNK] electrolyte exhibited a discernible improvement in coulombic efficiency ( over [UNK] % ) upon cycling at 30 c ( fig .
[UNK] and [UNK] v ( the [UNK] voltage between anodic and cathodic peaks for lim ##n2 ##o ##4 [ 26 ] ) , which become one as the peaks broaden .
the charge voltage plateau below [UNK] v are assigned to oxidation of li ##2 ##o2 , while those over [UNK] v are attributed to oxidation of li ##2 ##co ##3 and / or li ##oh associated with the decomposition of organic electrolyte at high voltage .
the activation property of the li ##2 ##s / c hybrids was tested by charging the cells from the [UNK] voltage to [UNK] v [UNK] li / [UNK] at a current density of [UNK] c ( 1 c = 116 ##6 ma [UNK] ) using an electrochemical testing system ( new ##are technology [UNK] , chi ##na ) .
the sharp peak around the voltage of [UNK] v can be attributed to the slope change of the fe ##2 ##o ##3 discharge platform with cycling .

this observation of g ##cd profile shows that the initial discharge and charge capacities of the r ##go / w ##o ##3 electrode are 112 ##0 and 64 ##1 ma h g 1 , respectively , with an initial coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % ( fig .
finally , it can be seen that the charge capacity still remains at [UNK] ma h g 1 even over 1000 cycles , verifying that the ordered structure of the si ##ox ##cy lm is helpful to the good cycling stability .
when applied as the cathode material in [UNK] batteries , the v2 ##o ##5 nanobelts delivered a capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 at a current density of 80 ma g 1 .
8 , a flat voltage plateau around [UNK] v ( [UNK] li / [UNK] ) appears in the charge process and a plateau around [UNK] v in the discharge process , which is the characteristic of the electrochemical reaction between li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 and li ##7 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 during charge and discharge process [ 42 ] .
during the electrochemical reaction , w ##o ##3 optical transmittance abruptly decreased from [UNK] % to [UNK] % at a wavelength of 633 nm when a voltage of [UNK] v [UNK] ag / ag ##cl was applied .
na ##2 ##li ##2 ##ti ##6 ##o ##14 ( nl ##to ) has a low intercalation voltage plateau at about [UNK] v ( [UNK] li / li + ) and could be expected higher energy density than that of li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 anode [ [UNK] ] .
on the other hand , the voltage gap of [UNK] l ##dh nanosheets electrode ( [UNK] v ) is smaller than that of cu ##co ##2 ##o ##4 electrode ( [UNK] v ) .
the average charge voltage plateaus of cu ##co ##2 ##o ##4 electrode is increased to [UNK] v after 20 cycles , leading to a large overpotential gap of [UNK] v ( fig .
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were conducted at constant voltage mode ( [UNK] v [UNK] ag / ag ##cl ) by sweeping the frequency from 55 kh ##z to 10 m ##h ##z at an amplitude of 5 m ##v .
alternatively , soc ##l2 is the ‘ ‘ cath ##olyte ’ ’ and when coupled with lithium metal as the anode provides a nominal voltage of [UNK] v per cell .
life ##po ##4 exhibits a voltage of [UNK] v , a specific capacity of 150 ma h g 1 , and an energy density of [UNK] k ##w h kg 1 , comparable to lic ##oo ##2 .
the [UNK] voltage curves of the ni ##3 ##c electrode at a current density of [UNK] a g - ##1 between [UNK] and [UNK] v were shown in figure 5b .

4a , it can be found that the two materials both exhibit perfect voltage plateau at around [UNK] v , which is corresponding to the [UNK] transition reaction between [UNK] ( life ##po ##4 ) and [UNK] ( fe ##po ##4 ) [ [UNK] ] .
in contrast , the pristine life ##po ##4 just reveals the discharge capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 .
for example , cho ##i et [UNK] found that coating l ##co with lithium phosphorus oxy ##ni ##tri ##de ( lip ##on ) improves the cycl ##ability , rate capability and thermal stability of l ##co between [UNK] and [UNK] v at a current density of [UNK] ( table 5 ) , due to the reasonably high [UNK] conductivity ( b1 ##0 6 s cm 1 ) and wide electrochemical voltage window ( [UNK] v ) of lip ##on .
the synthesized mp ##n @ fe ##3 ##o ##4 electrocatalysts have a dec ##ent conductivity of [UNK] s cm 1 even though the organic mp ##n layers are typically insulating , suggesting the presence of highly conductive fe ##3 ##o ##4 cores was critical for electrical conductivity .
all the samples present the flat voltage plateau at around [UNK] v that characterize life ##po ##4 due to the simultaneous coexistence of fe ##po ##4 phase during the li ##þ insertion / de ##ins ##ert ##ion process .
the voltage plateau at [UNK] v is proportional to the surface entr ##ated h2 ##so ##4 and h ##no ##3 acid solution for ( a ) 5 , ( b ) 10 , ( c ) 20 h , and ts ( arrow ) .
additionally , the nico ##2 ##o ##4 ns ##s / / ac asc exhibit high specific capacitance of 119 f g 1 , high energy density of [UNK] wh kg 1 , and excellent cycle stability .
when the initial concentration of na ##oh is below [UNK] m and that of hc ##oo ##h is [UNK] m , the voltage is lower than [UNK] v , indicating that the electrolysis of formic acid is desirable to produce h2 for pe ##m ##fc .
the voltage of lin ##o ##3 reduces on graphite surface is about [UNK] v based both we detected in the cv test ( for the [UNK] half cells and the [UNK] @ pc full cell ) and the literature report [ 38 ] .

to confirm the dependence on an operation voltage range , the [UNK] tests were carried out in the narrower potential range between [UNK] and [UNK] v , and the composite products were compared to each single phase of - ##mn ##o2 and stoichiometric lim ##n2 ##o ##4 [ 26 ] as shown in fig .
the pt ##co n ##ws can effectively reduce the charge voltage below [UNK] v , but have to induce the decomposition of the conventional liquid electrolyte .
the [UNK] faceted pt ##co n ##ws catalyst can effectively reduce the charge voltage below [UNK] v , but facilitate the decomposition of the [UNK] electrolyte .
the open circuit voltage for the battery system is found to increase from [UNK] v at a 1m n ##h4 ##cl concentration to [UNK] v at a 5m concentration of n ##h4 ##cl .
7a at the current density of 300 ##ma g−1 between [UNK] and 3 [UNK] as shown , the ti ##o2 / mo ##o2 / fe ##3 ##o ##4 composite exhibited an initial discharge capacity of [UNK] g−1 and the initial coulombic efficiency ( ce ) of [UNK] % .
sci . , 2015 , 8 , 353 ##1 [UNK] 353 ##8 this journal is ##© ##the ro ##ya ##l society of chemistry 2015 capacity ( 113 ##2 ma h g 1 for sn ##4 ##p3 , according to sn ##4 ##p3 + 24 ##na + + 24 ##e - na ##15 ##s ##n ##4 + 3n ##a3 ##p ) , [UNK] but the theoretical volumetric capacity ( 66 ##50 ma h cm 3 for sn ##4 ##p3 [UNK] 57 ##10 ma h cm 3 for p ) 32 and the electrical conductivity ( [UNK] s cm 1 for sn ##4 ##p3 [UNK] [UNK] 10 5 s cm 1 for p / c composites ) 29 of the anode are greatly increased , rendering the exploration of this intermetallic compound as an anode material for [UNK] batteries .
then , a long discharge voltage platform at about [UNK] v is observed for [UNK] , which is higher than that for pure mn ##co ##3 ( about [UNK] v ) reported [ 45 ] .
the durability of ni / ni ##o / nico ##2 ##o ##4 / [UNK] was tested at a constant voltage of [UNK] v vs rhe for 2200 ##0 s in an [UNK] [UNK] k ##oh solution at a rotation rate of 1600 rpm ( fig .
life ##po ##4 shows high working voltage ( [UNK] v ) and a theoretical capacity of 170 ma ##h / g .
this reversible capacity was remarkably higher than the theoretical capacities of both ni ##3 ##n ( [UNK] ma h g 1 ) and co ##3 ##n ( [UNK] ma h g 1 ) .
galvanostatic measurements of the charge / discharge of the li / lic ##oo ##2 cells were conducted within the voltage range between [UNK] and [UNK] v with a current density of 27 ma g 1 at 25 1c using a multichannel [UNK] ( [UNK] , w ##onate ##ch , k ##ore ##a ) .
( c ) x ##rd pattern of the li ##xc ##oo ##2 electrode at soc 0 approached by [UNK] of the cathode ( voltage decay to [UNK] v ) , which had been heated at 60 1c overnight compared with that of the electrode from the reference lic ##oo ##2 .
to better compare the lin ##o ##3 and dis ##iloxane cells , we limited the discharge voltage of the 30 % [UNK] cell to [UNK] v between cycle 60 and 70 , so that both cells ran in the same voltage window for 10 cycles .
the double redox couple from ni has increased the working voltage of [UNK] to [UNK] v due to the increased binding energy of ni 3d electrons , which was reported to be [UNK] ev higher than mn 3d eg electrons [ 23 ] .
the curves show a typical high voltage plateau at [UNK] v , which is considerably higher than the traditional cathode materials such as lic ##oo ##2 ( [UNK] v ) and life ##po ##4 ( [UNK] v ) .
the [UNK] / m ##w ##cn ##t electrodes can maintain 118 ma ##h / g capacity and [UNK] v voltage during 10c charge / discharge .
in contrast , dn ##a for [UNK] remains stable above [UNK] v , and the voltage curve of this material has few features .
in addition , the high initial charge specific capacity up to [UNK] ma h [UNK] of sn ##o2 can be ascribed that [UNK] facilitates the decomposition of li ##2 ##o and promotes the reversibility of reaction ( 1 ) [ 28 ] .
however , for pristine sn ##o2 , a capacity of [UNK] ma h [UNK] was retained in 100 cycles and only [UNK] % β - tin was remained simultaneously .
obviously , pure s ##b2 ##o ##3 exhibits a poor cycling performance and the reversible capacity decreases to [UNK] ma h g - ##1 at 20th cycle and maintains [UNK] ma h g - ##1 after 50 cycles .
it is worth noting that the poorly defined plateau at about [UNK] v associated with the reduction of sn ##o2 to sn becomes ind ##isc ##ern ##ible in the following cycles , which suggests the irreversibility of this reaction within the narrow voltage window .
during the removal process of na ##cl , the redox reaction of mn ##o2 could occur when the cell voltage was controlled at [UNK] v [ 18 ] .
the second voltage plateau observed at around [UNK] v was ascribed to the removal of f spinel lim ##n2 ##o ##4 using glucose as a fuel , ceramics international ( 2012 ) , fig .

a small voltage plateau at around [UNK] v can be noticed in the initial discharge process , which is attributed to the formation of sn and li ##2 ##o [ 20 ] .
when the voltage reaches the [UNK] v plateau ( 1 < x < 2 in li ##x ##v2 ##o ##5 ) , the - ##phase is transformed into the - ##phase , a substantially distinct structure ( figure 3d ) .

the same average voltage , [UNK] v , is also assumed for all three ni ##oo ##h batteries [ 45 ] .
however , serious capacity decay is observed and the capacity of the pure mos ##e2 anode decreases to [UNK] ma h g 1 aer 100 cycles .
furthermore , ni ##s film electrode composed of nanorods / nan ##plate ##s demonstrates energy density of [UNK] wh [UNK] ( at ma [UNK] ) and power density of [UNK] k ##w [UNK] ( 50 ma [UNK] ) with excellent ( 96 % ) cyclic stability up to 1000 cycles .
this oxidation peak did not appear in the 1st cycle , which is because there was no li ##2 ##o2 on the electrode since the 1st scan was from [UNK] v to higher voltage .
after 200 cycles , the coulombic efficiency of azo @ s / cn ##t and z ##no @ s / cn ##t cathodes are approximately [UNK] % and s / cn ##t is 99 % .

lm ##p delivers a higher operating voltage of [UNK] v than l ##fp , which is practically achievable within the stability window of conventional carbonate [UNK] electrolytes , and also means higher energy density it behaves than l ##fp .
an average voltage plateau at around [UNK] v is realized , which is comparable to the tin ##b2 ##o ##7 ( around [UNK] v ) 43 .
ei ##s tests were measured at [UNK] v over the frequency range of [UNK] to 105 h ##z at an alternating current ( ac ) voltage of [UNK] [UNK] the x ##rd diffraction patterns of fe ##s2 and fe ##s2 / cn ##t powders are shown in fig .

galvanostatic cycling at room temperature of the life ##po ##4 sample was conducted over the voltage range of [UNK] to [UNK] v at a c / 20 rate in a sw ##agel ##ok [UNK] .
the curve plateau over a wide voltage range at approximately [UNK] v ( versus li / [UNK] ) implies that a two phase 25 [UNK] / [UNK] redox reaction took place via the [UNK] transition between fe ##po ##4 and life ##po ##4 .
then , the voltage plateau corresponding to the li ##þ insertion / desert ##ion in ti ##o2 was clearly visible around [UNK] v [UNK] li ##þ / li .
by contrast , the first discharge capacity of the pure sn ##s2 was only [UNK] ma h g - ##1 and degrade to [UNK] ma h g - ##1 at 200 ma g - ##1 after 100 cycles , showing the poor cycling stability .
normally , aqueous electrolytes exhibit high conductivity ( for example , about [UNK] s cm 2 for 1 m h2 ##so ##4 at 25 1c ) , which is at least one order of magnitude higher than that of organic and il [UNK] this is beneficial for lowering the es ##r , leading to a better power delivery of ess .
for example , the ionic conductivity of the commonly used 1 m tea ##bf ##4 / ac ##n electrolyte is [UNK] s cm 1 , which is significantly lower than that of the 30 wt % h2 ##so ##4 electrolyte ( [UNK] s cm 1 at 25 1c ) . ##29 the low conductivity of the organic electrolyte can result in es a much higher es ##r compared to the aqueous electrolyte ##ba ##sed [UNK] which then limits the maximum power density .
high voltage and energy density was obtained by using nm ##ete ##mp ##o cath ##olyte , however , the cost of redox material is fairly [UNK] , 31 moreover , due to the relative low ion conductivity of ph neutral electrolytes , the power densities of the neutral a ##or ##f ##bs are still not competitive with those of strong alkaline and acidic [UNK] , 22 herein , we exploit the high redox potential ( [UNK] v vs n ##he ) and high capacity ( [UNK] m or [UNK] a ##h / l ) ammonium bromide cath ##olyte , n ##h4 ##br , in ph neutral a ##or ##f ##b for the first time by pairing with [UNK] ’ - ##bis ( [UNK] ) [UNK] ’ - ##bi ##pyr ##idinium ( ( spr ) 2 ##v ) as an an ##olyte .

this is mainly because l ##to exhibits excellent [UNK] insertion / extraction reversibility with zero structural change and a relatively higher operating voltage ( [UNK] v vs li / [UNK] ) to ensure batter safety of the battery by avoiding the trou ##ble of lib ##s [ [UNK] ] .
the extra charge capacity is strongly related to the characteristic feature of li ##2 ##mn ##o ##3 , possibly due to simultaneous removal of lithium and oxide ions during the voltage plateau region above [UNK] v in the [UNK] voltage increase .
the open circuit voltage of solid state [UNK] battery using [UNK] / mn ##ox electrode achieved [UNK] v and stabilized above [UNK] v for 240 min , as shown in fig .

the major voltage profile of cp lies at a voltage below [UNK] v , showing three stages corresponding mainly to the formation of lithiated compounds li ##xc ##6 ( 0 ##oxo ##1 ) similar to those of graphite anodes reported [ 6 ] .
the difference ( [UNK] v ) in the plateau voltage between the charging and discharging processes originates from the intrinsic internal resistance of the l ##fp cathode .
thus , the structural stability of the l ##co constituent , extends the practical operating voltage range up to [UNK] v while simultaneously absorbing the overshoot debris which occurs due to accumulated currents within the l ##fp .
during the initial reduction cycle , an unint ##err ##up ##ted profile was observed until the voltage reached [UNK] v ; a further reduction leads to the destruction of z ##n ##co ##2 ##o ##4 and the subsequent formation of a sharp peak at [UNK] v corresponding to metal formation and the alloying of li and z ##n .
3 , it can clearly be seen that the [UNK] lim ##n ##po ##4 at moderate reactant concentration and 300 8c exhibits an electrochemical activity with charge and discharge plateaus around the voltage of [UNK] v [UNK] [UNK] / li and its initial discharge capacity is [UNK] ma h g 1 .

this was most likely due to the presence of the la ##o coating , which affected the release of li ##þ and o ##2 ( as li ##2 ##o ) extracted from the [UNK] lattice , resulting in a decrease in charge capacity after the voltage reached [UNK] v or higher [ [UNK] ] .
this is due to the approximately [UNK] v lower operating voltage as compared to the graphite anode as well as the slightly lower capacity of the l ##to material .
furthermore , the energy density which can be extracted from the cn ##ts supercapacitor in na ##2 ##so ##4 is around [UNK] wh kg 1 at a current density of 1 a g 1 .

the latter can be estimated from the specific conductivity , k , of the 5 m h2 ##so ##4 which was measured as [UNK] s cm 1 , and the [UNK] distance l ¼ [UNK] cm to be rac ##ida ¼ l / k ¼ [UNK] o cm2 ( rac ##id ¼ [UNK] o ) ; obviously , it also depends on the specific electrochemical cell arrangement and particularly on the shape of the electric field and the [UNK] gaps .

materials such as the titanate spinel li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 ) are receiving significant attention as alternative ‘ safer ’ nodes , although a significant drawback with this approach is he higher operating voltage of around [UNK] v [UNK] li .
notably , the lower voltage drop of [UNK] v for ma ##mn ##sp ##s suggests lower internal resistance , which is the result of thinner mn ##o2 in the ma ##mn ##sp structure since it has the largest area among all three structures with the same mn ##o2 mass loading .

the discharge voltage of cr ##2 ##o ##5 / na cell is close to [UNK] v and thus the energy density can reach 54 ##1 wh / kg .
similar to other [UNK] cathodes , the cells made with pristine and [UNK] [UNK] electrodes exhibited a voltage plateau around [UNK] v , which is related to the concomitant extraction of lithium and oxygen from the li ##2 ##mn ##o ##3 host structure during the initial charging [ [UNK] ] .

two voltage plateaus can be observed at about [UNK] v and [UNK] v , which are attributed to the intercalation of lithium ions into the mos ##2 lattice and the complete reduction of mos ##2 , respectively [ [UNK] ] .
ds ##sc ##s employing mos ##2 as ce , exhibited excellent 40 pc ##e of [UNK] % owing to j ##sc of [UNK] ma / cm 2 , [UNK] voltage ( vo ##c ) of [UNK] v , and fill factor ( ff ) of [UNK] .
the current density can be calculated from the theoretical capacity of [UNK] ( [UNK] ma h g 21 ) and the mass of this compound in the cathode composite .
with [UNK] methods , the two voltage plateaus are shown at [UNK] v and [UNK] v due to the presence of one ( and only ) intermediate stable phase at [UNK] .

the optimized polymer electrolyte was used to construct an [UNK] li / lim ##n2 ##o ##4 cell , which presents a superior discharge capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 and excellent capacity retention aer 200 cycles .
the other voltage plateau at approximately [UNK] v refers to the conversion reaction of the [UNK] complex to fe and li ##2 ##o ( eq .
in case of the ti ##o2 / c nanocomposite , the charge and discharge capacity of the carbon shell in the ti ##o2 / c nanocomposite can be ignored since the intercalation voltage of lithium ion into the amorphous carbon material prepared here is below [UNK] v [ [UNK] ] .

recently , ki ##m ’ s group synthesized a multiphase cu ##3 ##ge / geo ##x / cu ##ge ##o ##3 nanowires anode which by partial reduction of cu ##ge ##o ##3 nanowires and acquired an improvement in initial coulombic [UNK] it is worth noting that cu ##3 ##ge possesses an extraordinary high electrical conductivity of ( [UNK] ) ×10 ##7 s [UNK] , which is much higher than that of pure ge ( [UNK] s [UNK] ) .
a full cell using lic ##oo ##2 cathode shows its initial coulombic efficiency increases to [UNK] % from [UNK] % after combining hard carbon with [UNK] as anode materials .
the [UNK] cycling performances of life ##po ##4 were tested on channels battery analyzer ( ct ##300 ##8 ##w ) at different current densities between [UNK] and [UNK] v [UNK] voltage using the [UNK] .
impressive ##ly , the optimized cu ##co ##2 ##o ##4 @ mn ##o2 / / ag ac ##s cell can be cycled reversibly in a wide voltage region as high as [UNK] v and exhibits a specific capacitance of 78 f [UNK] at a current density of 1 a [UNK] with a maximum energy density of [UNK] wh [UNK] .
the use of the li ( al ) / ag ##2 ##cr ##o ##4 couple with the [UNK] eutectic electrolyte was briefly explored , in hope ##s of increasing the open circuit voltage to slightly over [UNK] v versus a nominal [UNK] v for the li ( si ) / fe ##s2 couple under the same conditions .
for the thermal test , the lic ##oo ##2 / c cell was cycled three times between [UNK] v and [UNK] v , and then was charged to [UNK] v and continued for 1 h to ensure its voltage was kept at [UNK] v when it is disassemb ##led .
during the charging process , all the samples exhibit two distinguishable stages , a smoothly sloping voltage profile below [UNK] v corresponding to li ##þ [UNK] from lm ##n ##co component and a long plateau around [UNK] v related to li ##þ and o ##2 extracted from the li ##2 ##mn ##o ##3 phase and structural rearrangement .
[UNK] v down to [UNK] [UNK] the discharge voltage cutoff of [UNK] v is suggested because at lower cell voltages the oxygen reduction can proc ##ced by an irreversible reaction that yield li ##2 ##o , a species that can not be electrochemically [UNK] to o ##2 at reasonable low voltages .
comparing with l ##fp , lm ##p not only has the similar theoretical capacity , but also provides a higher operating voltage of [UNK] v [ 8 , 9 ] , so it has attracted great attention ##s .
due to the contribution of the photovoltage , the photoc ##ha ##r ##ging voltage of the life ##po ##4 cathode was reduced to [UNK] v ( fig .
in this battery , the fundamental electrochemical e ##action is : [UNK] + 2e− + o ##2 ↔ li ##2 ##o2 , which relies on the reversible or ##ma ##tion and decomposition of li ##2 ##o2 upon cycling with an equi ##ibrium voltage of [UNK] v [UNK] li / [UNK] [ 63 ] .
among the above cathode mat ##ei ##als , [UNK] ( ln ##mo ) shows excellent properties with an ver ##age discharge voltage of [UNK] v and a theoretical capacity of [UNK] ma ##h g−1 [ 11 ] .

when increases the charging voltage to [UNK] v , the electrode changes to a phase that is roughly similar to orthorhombic na ##9 ##s ##n ##4 structure .
the chemical diffusion coefficient values of [UNK] cm2 s−1 and a nearly reversible insertion / de ##ins ##ert ##ion in the voltage range between [UNK] and [UNK] v point out that li ##1−x ##ag ##2 ##s ##n is another example of a ternary intermetallic compound with good lithium and electron mobility .
the lower [UNK] voltage at [UNK] v is commonly used in the study of amorphous ti ##o2 [ 16 ] .
more importantly , the stable [UNK] voltage could be enhanced to as high as [UNK] [UNK] spherical [UNK] ( nc ##m ##52 ##3 ) , cycling to voltages greater than [UNK] v , often suffers from structure instability and the resultant inferior cycl ##ability .
the voltage plateau below [UNK] v was due to cu extrusion from the li ##2 ##c ##us ##n structure to yield [UNK] .
to further investigate the high voltage performance of [UNK] g ##cp ##e , [UNK] cathode material [UNK] ( ln ##mo ) was used to cooper ##ated with lithium metal anode to charge and discharge from [UNK] v to [UNK] v at 25 ° ##c .

here , the positive electrode of lic ##oo ##2 has a greater capacity than the sufficient capacity of the [UNK] formed electrode at room temperature , and the [UNK] operating voltage of lic ##oo ##2 is [UNK] v [UNK] li / [UNK] .
when the voltage is between [UNK] and [UNK] v , the intermediate product of li ##x ##v2 ##o ##3 is formed during the insertion process , resulting in a gradual decrease of the discharge plateau .
but on further cycling , at the 10th discharge , when significant portion of the voltage profile covers the [UNK] v plateau , traces of li ##2 ##co ##3 can be seen in the discharged cathode .
freshly prepared thin lic ##oo ##2 electrodes with open circuit voltage ( oc ##v ) values of about [UNK] v ( [UNK] li / [UNK] ) were initially cycled three times ( voltammetry ) between [UNK] and [UNK] v ( [UNK] li / [UNK] ) at [UNK] m ##v s−1 before the electrochemical measurements .
the charging voltage was compar ##ably close to the theoretical potential ( [UNK] v ) of li ##2 ##o2 to be decomposed directly via 2 electron transfer process , indicating that li ##2 ##o2 must be formed as a main discharge product .
the spec ##ic capacity values are calculated according to the mass of [UNK] the [UNK] cell with s ##8 exhibits an [UNK] voltage ( oc ##v ) above [UNK] v , while it is [UNK] v with li ##2 ##s ##n , re ##ecting the different potential states of li ##2 ##s ##n and s ##8 .
however , this ( li ##3 ##n ) possesses a small decomposition voltage ( [UNK] v ) [ 9 ] , which renders it too complex to be utilized as an electrolyte for a solid lithium battery .
pure fe ##2 ##o ##3 , co ##3 ##o ##4 and v2 ##o ##5 were prepared under constant voltage of [UNK] v in the electrolytes of fe ##so ##4 ( [UNK] m ) , cos ##o ##4 ( [UNK] m ) and vo ##so ##4 ( [UNK] m ) , respectively .

whereas a large number of studies focus on the voltage range between [UNK] and [UNK] v , no investigation was reported on the rate cycling performance of [UNK] li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 discharged to [UNK] v synthesized by the hydrothermal method .
the l ##to electrode delivered a reversible capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 aer 200 cycles with only [UNK] % capacity loss , which con ##r ##med that the [UNK] pure li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 nanoparticles in this work show a high capacity with excellent capacity retention .
4c , the v2 ##o ##5 microf ##low ##ers depicts a discharge capacity of [UNK] ma h [UNK] during the 100 ##th cycle with a capacity retention of [UNK] % of the initial capacity .
in comparison , the [UNK] discharge capacity of v2 ##o ##5 octahedron ##s is [UNK] ma h [UNK] , which corresponds to a capacity retention of [UNK] % of the initial capacity .
and a stable capacity of [UNK] ma h [UNK] is achieved by v2 ##o ##5 microf ##low ##ers when the current density is decreased to [UNK] .
the initial discharge and charge capacities of cn ##f / [UNK] are [UNK] and [UNK] g 1 , respectively , corresponding to an initial coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % .
for cr ##2 ##o ##3 thin film deposited on ni ( cr ##2 ##o ##3 / ni ) , a discharge capacity of [UNK] ma h g - ##1 can be delivered during the first lithiation process .

the electrical conductivity measured by a four point probe technique ( table s2 ) follows the sequence of [UNK] / sn ##o2 ( [UNK] s cm 1 ) > [UNK] / sn ##o2 ##l ( [UNK] s cm 1 ) > [UNK] ( [UNK] s cm 1 ) , demonstrating that the electrical conductivity of [UNK] / sn ##o2 rises with increasing the s ##b content .
after 30 cycles , the sn ##o2 @ c [UNK] spheres are able to deliver a high reversible capacity of [UNK] ma h g−1 , which is much higher than that of sn ##o2 spheres ( [UNK] ma h g −1 ) .
besides , there are mainly another two voltage plateaus at about [UNK] v and [UNK] v respectively in the first discharge of the 3d porous mn ##3 ##o ##4 nas electrode .
the voltage plateaus at about [UNK] v maybe caused from the reaction between mn ##3 ##o ##4 and li , the voltage plateaus at about [UNK] v is caused from the reaction between the mn ##o and li according to the literature [ 2 ] .
electrochemical tests showed that the [UNK] composite exhibited higher nit ##ial coulombic efficiency ( [UNK] % ) than ni ##o ( [UNK] % ) , and better cycling performances .
in addition , long and reversible voltage plateau pairs are observed at [UNK] v in all 1st cycle voltage profiles , caused by reversible oxidation state changes between [UNK] and [UNK] in lic ##oo ##2 .
as we know , lic ##oo ##2 based cells ( [UNK] v ) show a higher charge / discharge voltage platform than life ##po ##4 ( [UNK] v ) , which can easily cause a more rapid decomposition process of te ##pi , resulting more additional reactions and thereby leading to the lower coulombic efficiency .

li ##2 ##z ##nt ##i ##3 ##o ##8 / c nanocomposite prepared by tang et [UNK] delivered a discharge capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 at a current density as high as [UNK] a g 1 .
moreover , the voltage plateaus at around [UNK] and [UNK] v are verified as the lithium ion insertion / extraction reaction of anatase ti ##o2 .
7c , d ) also shows that the superior capacity of mn ##2 ##s ##no ##4 @ c over mn ##o / sn ##o2 @ c mainly comes from the voltage region above [UNK] v , which is relative to the reversible transformation from sn ##o2 to sn .
the initial discharge ##charge capacity of mc is [UNK] and [UNK] ma ##h g−1 , with the initial coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % , while the initial [UNK] capacity of mc / [UNK] is [UNK] and [UNK] ma ##h g−1 , with the initial coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % .
the large initial irreversible loss is attributed to the irreversible reduction of mo ##o2 to mo and other possible irreversible processes ( electrolyte decomposition and the formation of se ##i layer ) . ##47 the initial coulombic efficiency of mo ##o ##3 nanobelts / cn ##ts is [UNK] % ( fig .
the higher voltage ( > [UNK] v ) [UNK] phase transition of [UNK] in the [UNK] cell was able to occur because of the larger electrochemical potential voltage window .

its electrochemical performances were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic [UNK] , which shown a large discharge capacity of [UNK] ma ##h [UNK] at the current density of 20 ma [UNK] with an original coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % , larger than that of nc ##s or fe ##2 ##o ##3 electrodes .
3d ) also reveal the obvious polarization and low initial coulombic efficiency ( only [UNK] % ) of fe ##2 ##o ##3 .
an aqueous ti ##o2 / fe ##2 ##þ hybrid battery with voltage of [UNK] v was successfully tested with an areal capacity of [UNK] cm 2 .
in addition , li ##u et [UNK] have reported tiny octahedra constructed hierarchically porous anatase ti ##o2 microspheres for lib ##s , which deliver a large capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 after 200 cycles at 1c , high rate performance and excellent cycling stability .
have prepared hierarchical hollow v2 ##o ##5 nanospheres with predominantly exposed { 110 } [UNK] when applied as the cathode material for [UNK] batteries , the v2 ##o ##5 hollow nanospheres exhibit a high initial capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 at 20 ma g 1 .
the li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 also exhibits initial capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 and but its capacity fade faster to [UNK] ma h g 1 in totally 150 cycles , suffering a more than 19 % capacity loss .
all cells were charged up to x = [UNK] in li ##1−x ##co ##o2 110 ma ##h g−1 ) and discharged to [UNK] v until the second cycle , nd then [UNK] cycles were repeated between the axi ##mu ##m charge voltage of the second cycle and [UNK] v after the hi ##rd cycle .
all the samples display a pair of [UNK] voltage profiles , which are different from the characteristic voltage plateaus at ~ [UNK] v for anatase ti ##o2 .
moreover , the initial discharge specific capacities are [UNK] , [UNK] and [UNK] ma h g 1 for li ##2 ##z ##nt ##i ##3 ##o ##8 , [UNK] and [UNK] , respectively , and the capacity of [UNK] composite is close to the theoretic capacity .
na ##2 ##ti ##3 ##o ##7 electrode exhibited a first discharge capacity of 177 ma h g 1 and a relative low cycling stability with capacity retention ##s of [UNK] % after 90 cycles at the [UNK] c rate over a voltage window of [UNK] [UNK] v [UNK] na / na ##þ [ 28 ] .
more importantly , the discharge voltage of l ##lo ##s with the optimized composition [UNK] is just [UNK] v ( [UNK] li / li ) , which is less than that of layered lic ##oo ##2 and lin ##ix ##co ##ym ##n1 ##−x ##−y ##o2 ( [UNK] v [UNK] li / li ) and spinel lim ##n2 ##o ##4 ( [UNK] v [UNK] li / li ) .
found that doping [UNK] with ni led to a discharge voltage of [UNK] v , which exceeded the discharge voltage of [UNK] v for [UNK] with the same current density .

[ [UNK] ] reported that metal phosphates ( fe ##2 ##p ) exhibit a high electron conductivity of approximately [UNK] s [UNK] .
for instance , li ##u et [UNK] an amorphous cos ##e film electrodeposited on a ti mesh ( [UNK] / ti ) for two electrode alkaline water electroly ##zer which affords a waters ##pl ##itting current of 10 ma cm−2 at a cell voltage of [UNK] v with strong [UNK] electrochemical stability .
similar to previous reports [ [UNK] ] , the first discharge voltage profile displays a long flat voltage plateau at about [UNK] v and then gradually decrease to 0 v , which may be a typical feature of co ##3 ##o ##4 anode .
in spite of their attractive capacity , none of these compounds show good capacity retention over the studied voltage range ( 0 to [UNK] v ) ; the main reason being root ##ed in the partial solubility of li ##2 ##s into the electrolyte .
although li ##2 ##mn ##o ##3 has a high theoretical capacity , it usually needs a high cutoff voltage ( [UNK] v [UNK] li ##þ / li ) during the initial charge process to activate li ##2 ##mn ##o ##3 , and the capacity decay of the activated li ##2 ##mn ##o ##3 is serious when cycling is performed at such high [UNK] voltage .
although the initial discharge capacity of those composites at [UNK] v [UNK] voltage is increasing upon enhancing the lim ##no ##2 content , their capacity decays are more obvious than the pristine li ##2 ##mn ##o ##3 as shown in fig .

the [UNK] lic ##oo ##2 cell has capacity retention of 91 % after 500 cycles in the full cell using carbon as the anode even at higher voltage limit to [UNK] v , while the pristine lic ##oo ##2 exhibited disapp ##oint ##ing cycling behaviors .
it was observed that the discharge capacity was larger in the case of ch ##3 ##n ##h3 ##p ##bb ##r3 ( [UNK] ma h g −1 ) as compared with that of ch ##3 ##n ##h3 ##p ##bi ##3 ( [UNK] ma h g −1 ) .
furthermore , the voltage difference between the anodic and cathodic peaks was also decreased from [UNK] v for the [UNK] ( 93 wt % ) sample to [UNK] v and [UNK] v for [UNK] ti ##o2 ( at 64 wt % and 52 wt % ) .
during this process , fresh surface was exposed upon electrochemical charge by releasing li ##x ##mo ##o ##3 into the electrolyte , inducing at the low charging voltage below [UNK] v at 100 ma cm 2 .

the cathode material utilization of life ##po ##4 in aqueous solutions with zinc metal as the anode was found to be 41 % ( 70 ma h g−1 ) for the first cycle with a voltage profile of [UNK] v [ 9 ] .
the initial discharge and charge capacities of [UNK] are [UNK] and [UNK] ma ##h g - ##1 , respectively , with a coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % .
moreover , compared with the traditional carbon anode , ti ##o2 anode delivers a relatively higher lithium insertion / extraction voltage ( higher than [UNK] v vs [UNK] / li ) , which can ensure adequate safety by efficiently * corresponding author .
it can be inferred from these single cell characteristics that the useful working voltage for negative activated carbon electrode is [UNK] v while that for the positive nan ##ip ##o ##4 electrode it is [UNK] v , resulting in a potential of [UNK] v for a full cell system .

nevertheless , the first coulombic efficiency of sn ##ox / c was still 4 % higher than that for the sn ##es ##no ##2 ##ec composite with 5 wt % sn ##o2 ( [UNK] % ) .
the conversion of bif ##5 into bif ##3 when first charging to 4 v could explain the first discharge step between [UNK] and [UNK] v , which are too high voltage values for the conversion of bif ##3 into bi .
in addition , as the tunnel na ##2 ##ti ##6 ##o ##13 content increased in the [UNK] hybrids , the loss of voltage plateaus at [UNK] v occurred at lower current densities .
the [UNK] [UNK] nanowire array delivers an initial discharge capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 at [UNK] c and maintains a high reversible capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 after 50 cycles , much higher than the unmodified co ##3 ##o ##4 nanowire array ( [UNK] ma h g ) .

according to he literature [ [UNK] ] , the discharge voltage first reaches a plateau t [UNK] v in the first cycle , but not in our test , it may be due to high ont ##ent of carbon in the fe ##3 ##o ##4 @ cn electrode .

however , the [UNK] sample shows an obvious augment in polarization voltage from [UNK] v to [UNK] v , which indicates that the reversible capability for [UNK] migration decreases during the cyclic process .
the [UNK] voltage gap of co ##3 ##o ##4 / g ##n electrodes at 1200 ma g - ##1 was only [UNK] v , which was 110 m ##v lower than that of co ##3 ##o ##4 electrodes ( [UNK] v ) .

when the voltage is below [UNK] v , the li ##3 ##vo ##4 electrode is activated and the low val ##ance state vanadium is formed , which help to enhance the electronic conductivity , the rc ##t is decreased and then reaches a certain value at the end of discharge .
thus , [UNK] ( ln ##mo ) becomes a compromised target for [UNK] cathode materials because ln ##mo exhibits a relatively lower dominant voltage plateau at [UNK] v [UNK] li / li ##þ than other lim ##x ##mn ##2 x ##o ##4 ( m ¼ cr , fe , co ) spinel ##s .

with the aid of ni ##fe ##2 ##o ##4 , the [UNK] batteries exhibit stable specific capacity and high coulombic efficiency ( [UNK] % for 11 cycles ) .
among the obtained [UNK] materials , [UNK] has the highest capacity at [UNK] v high voltage and a highest capacity retention of [UNK] % after 300 cycles under [UNK] .
however , the poor ionic conductivity ( 10 6 s cm 1 ) of the electrolyte and high internal resistance ( 900 x ) pl ##ague the applicability of the electrolyte for fabrication of any standard magnesium cell using mg / sap ##e / mn ##o2 assembly ( observed specific capacity [UNK] ma h g 1 was [UNK] % of the theoretical capacity of mn ##o2 cathode ) .
the maximum charge / discharge capacity was however observed to be [UNK] ma h g 1 corresponding to a reversible extraction / insertion of only [UNK] of [UNK] / [UNK] formula unit , with [UNK] % coulombic efficiency up to the 100 ##th cycle [ see fig .

the small size and the pure phase of sn ##4 ##p3 nanot ##ops result in a high capacity of [UNK] ma h g - ##1 and a good cycl ##ability ( 92 % capacity retention over 80 cycles at a current density of [UNK] a g - ##1 ) .

the anode from the [UNK] represents large discharge and charge capacities of 158 ##4 and 121 ##6 ma h g 1 , respectively , with a coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % in the first cycle because of the higher capacity of the si nanoparticles ( fig .
the cells using lim ##n2 ##o ##4 show higher [UNK] voltage of around [UNK] v ( [UNK] li ) and higher safety even at overc ##ha ##r ##ge condition compared with the cell using lic ##oo ##2 .
obviously , materials with nanostructures can achieve these requirements through elaborate [UNK] manganese monoxide ( mn ##o ) is widely concerned because of its environmental friend ##liness , abundant resources , low conversion potential , and voltage hysteresis ( < [UNK] v ) .
at the same current density , the cell voltage is comparable with most [UNK] bifunctional catalysts , such as [UNK] / r ##go ( [UNK] v ) , ##41 [UNK] ( [UNK] v ) , 42 nico ##2 ##o ##4 ( [UNK] v ) , 43 ni ##s / ni fig .
through this process , li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 displays a reversible specific capacity of 155 ##ma ##h g 1 with a coulombic efficiency [UNK] % after 50 cycles .
besides , the coulombic efficiency of the z ##ng ##a2 ##o ##4 nanocubes can still keep [UNK] % after 100 cycles , which reveals good cycle stability .
compared to z ##no and [UNK] arrays , a small voltage plateau appears near [UNK] v in the first lithiation process , which might relate to the reduction of co ##o into co via the reaction co ##o + [UNK] + 2e− → co + li ##2 ##o [ 12 ] .
two obvious voltage plateaus appear at around [UNK] v and [UNK] v in the initial discharge curve , which are ascribed to [UNK] intercalation into layered mos ##2 and the subsequent conversion from mos ##2 to mo and li ##2 ##s matrix , respectively [ 13 ] .
there are two voltage plateaus at about [UNK] and [UNK] v for the first lithiation process , corresponding to the formation of li ##x ##mo ##s2 and decomposition of li ##x ##mo ##s2 into mo particles embedded in the li ##2 ##s matrix , respectively [ [UNK] ] .
note that , the potential difference ( dv ) of the l ##to ##c ( [UNK] v ) is lower than that of the l ##to ( [UNK] v ) , which indicates that the l ##to ##c possesses a weak polarization due to the incorporation of conductive porous [UNK] additionally , a distinct peak of l ##to ##c appeared in the low voltage range approaching 0 v , which can be attributed to the [UNK] insertion into and extraction out of the carbon [UNK] thus , the cn ##ts in l ##to ##c not only improved the conductivity and reversibility of nanocomposites , but also increased the active sites for [UNK] storage .

the bare si ##ox shows a sloping voltage curve at [UNK] v [UNK] during the 1st discharge ( fig .
our ® ##nd ##ings prove that an intercalation reaction occurred in li / lin ##ivo ##4 cells at a plateau near [UNK] v , but we still do not know why the voltage of the li / lin ##ivo ##4 cell is so high .
the [UNK] compound , lic ##ov ##o ##4 , also [UNK] li , but at a much lower voltage , near [UNK] v [ 8 ] .
the initial discharge and charge capacities of cn ##f / [UNK] are [UNK] and [UNK] g 1 , respectively , corresponding to an initial coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % .

after growing cr ##2 ##o ##3 thin film on fl ##g / ni , the initial discharge capacity of cr ##2 ##o ##3 / fl ##g / ni was improved to [UNK] ma h g - ##1 .
in contrast , the co ##3 ##o ##4 anode delivers a slightly higher discharge capacity ( 186 ##7 ma h g 1 ) but suffers severe irreversible capacity loss , with a coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % in the first cycle ( fig .
for pure [UNK] , the system exhibits a flat [UNK] voltage profile at [UNK] v ( oxidation of [UNK] nt ##o [UNK] ) .
after 30 cycles , the sn ##o2 @ c [UNK] spheres are able to deliver a high reversible capacity of [UNK] ma h g−1 , which is much higher than that of sn ##o2 spheres ( [UNK] ma h g −1 ) .
similarly , there are also two voltage plateaus at about [UNK] v and [UNK] v respectively in the first discharge of the mn ##3 ##o ##4 nas , but are much lower than that of the 3d porous mn ##3 ##o ##4 nas .
the [UNK] ni ##2 ##p lm ##s displayed excellent electrochemical performance , including a [UNK] ma h g 1 reversible discharge capacity .
in addition , long and reversible voltage plateau pairs are observed at [UNK] v in all 1st cycle voltage profiles , caused by reversible oxidation state changes between [UNK] and [UNK] in lic ##oo ##2 .
as we know , lic ##oo ##2 based cells ( [UNK] v ) show a higher charge / discharge voltage platform than life ##po ##4 ( [UNK] v ) , which can easily cause a more rapid decomposition process of te ##pi , resulting more additional reactions and thereby leading to the lower coulombic efficiency .

the reduction of the cycling stability may be caused by the greater change in lattice parameters a and c or the appearance of new phases when charged to higher voltage ( [UNK] and [UNK] v in [UNK] / c batteries ) .
in the initial cycle of [UNK] @ mos ##2 , the first discharge and charge capacities of [UNK] @ mos ##2 electrode are 119 ##9 and 770 ma ##h g - ##1 , respectively , corresponding to a coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % ( fig .
5e , the [UNK] @ mos ##2 electrode delivers a reversible specific capacity around 90 ##8 ma ##h [UNK] after 2000 ##th cycle corresponding to a coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % with an ascending trend of capacity during the cycle process .
after voltage plateau , the curve of discharge ( below [UNK] v ) plays a primary part in the total capacity contribution rate that can be ascribed to the reversible surface / interface storage on the c @ ti ##o2 nanocomposites .
in particular , the discharge capacity of ti ##o2 only had [UNK] ma h g −1 when the rate rever ##ted to [UNK] a g−1 .
the galvanostatic charge and discharge profiles of the [UNK] % / sn ##o2 / carbon nanocomposite at the 1st , 2nd , 5th , 10th , 20th , 50 ##th and 100 ##th cycle at a current rate of 100 ##ma g−1 in the voltage range between [UNK] and [UNK] v are presented in fig .

in the case of z ##n2 ##s ##no ##4 , they were 208 ##1 and 96 ##9 ma h [UNK] , respectively , with a coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % .
the initial intercalation of lithium into crystalline bulk v2 ##o ##5 down to [UNK] v [UNK] [UNK] / li is characterized by a series of voltage plateaus linked to irreversible phase transitions from a to 3 , d , g and finally to a bad crystallized [UNK] [UNK] phase .
the li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 also exhibits initial capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 and but its capacity fade faster to [UNK] ma h g 1 in totally 150 cycles , suffering a more than 19 % capacity loss .
all cells were charged up to x = [UNK] in li ##1−x ##co ##o2 110 ma ##h g−1 ) and discharged to [UNK] v until the second cycle , nd then [UNK] cycles were repeated between the axi ##mu ##m charge voltage of the second cycle and [UNK] v after the hi ##rd cycle .
this shortc ##oming can be partly overcome by coupling with high voltage cathode materials such as [UNK] ( [UNK] v [UNK] li / [UNK] ) , or high capacity cathode materials such as [UNK] layered oxides li [ [UNK] ] o ##2 ( m = mn , ni , co ) .
all the samples display a pair of [UNK] voltage profiles , which are different from the characteristic voltage plateaus at ~ [UNK] v for anatase ti ##o2 .
moreover , the initial discharge specific capacities are [UNK] , [UNK] and [UNK] ma h g 1 for li ##2 ##z ##nt ##i ##3 ##o ##8 , [UNK] and [UNK] , respectively , and the capacity of [UNK] composite is close to the theoretic capacity .

but the energy density of ru ##o2 decreases rapidly to [UNK] wh kg 1 ( at 5000 w kg 1 ) when the power density is more than 1000 w kg 1 .
in sharp contrast , the graphene / ru ##o2 composite still retains a high energy density of [UNK] wh kg 1 at 5000 w kg 1 and [UNK] wh kg 1 at a power density as high as he ##ne / ru ##o2 composite ( ro ##gs ##cs ) ec ##s .
spinel li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 has a relatively high lithiation voltage plateau at [UNK] v [UNK] [UNK] / li , which avoids lithium plating and the formation of the insulating [UNK] interface ( se ##i ) ; hence it is very safe [ 12 ] .

a stable l ##to anode ##ma ##ter ##ial ##work ##ing at a relatively high voltage avoids the formation of passiv ##ating ##fi ##lm , since the se ##i formation occurs below [UNK] v [UNK] [UNK] / li ##0 [ 36 ] .
however , its practical capac ##ty is only ∼13 ##7 ma ##h g−1 , as the structural stability of li ##1−x ##co ##o2 s only maintained at a limited compositional range of 0 < x < [UNK] the charging [UNK] voltage is limited to [UNK] v ) .
as was reported , the long voltage plateau around [UNK] v is associated to a conversion from co ##3 ##o ##4 to li ##xc ##o ##3 ##o ##4 or co ##o , and then to co during the lithium insertion process [ [UNK] ] .
the discharge plate of [UNK] is about [UNK] v , and the charge voltage is generally higher than 5 [UNK] due to the lacking of proper electrolyte , the discharge capacity of [UNK] is very low , as shown in fig .
although the initial discharge capacity of those composites at [UNK] v [UNK] voltage is increasing upon enhancing the lim ##no ##2 content , their capacity decays are more obvious than the pristine li ##2 ##mn ##o ##3 as shown in fig .
in the [UNK] curves , both of them exhibit voltage plateaus at [UNK] v , subsequently declines to cutoff voltages of [UNK] v gradually , indicating typical characteristics of voltage prol ##es trends for co ##3 ##o ##4 anode .
as for pure cu ##5 ##v2 ##o ##10 nanoparticle , the initial discharge and charge capacities are [UNK] and [UNK] ma h g 1 , respectively , and the irreversible capacity loss is about [UNK] % ( fig .

the long voltage tail at below [UNK] v in the discharge process can be ascribed to the deep conversion reaction of partially lithiated [UNK] the [UNK] composites do not have clear voltage plateaus associated with the mo ##o2 phase possibly because of the contribution of the carbon phase .

5b , the first discharge capacity of the [UNK] can reach [UNK] ma h g - ##1 and the consequent charge capacity can reach [UNK] ma h [UNK] .
at the current density of 1000 ma [UNK] , the [UNK] still delivers a reversible capacity of [UNK] ma h g - ##1 , while the capacity of [UNK] was only [UNK] ma h [UNK] at the same condition .
the current of ti ##o2 nanotube arrays in the dark between [UNK] v and [UNK] v external voltage is rather low ( < [UNK] ma / cm2 ) , which means no hydrogen is generated .
moreover , the mg ##h2 possessed much lower voltage hysteresis ( less than [UNK] v ) than other metal oxides , nitrides , sulfides , phosph ##ides and fluorides [ 485 ##a ] .
the reversible electrochemical reaction at voltage plateaus around [UNK] v which 25 is the characteristic phase transition between fe ##po ##4 and life ##po ##4 .
it should be also noted that the constant voltage profile ( dq / dv e ##ak potential ) of the discharge curve dropped from [UNK] v to . ##3 v as the rate increased from c / 2 to 5c irrespective of how he life ##po ##4 was prepared due to the contact and matrix resis ##ance related to the limited electronic conductivity of the ph ##osh ##ate [ 29 ] .

for a pristine he ##nm ##c , the discharge capacity , in theory , mostly originates from the voltage above [UNK] v , considering the voltage window of [UNK] to [UNK] ( [UNK] v ) and lithium insertion into mn ##o2 ( [UNK] v ) .

however , the product at voltage of [UNK] v is [UNK] nat ##i2 ##o ##4 with orthorhombic calcium [UNK] figure 2 .
as a result , the li / li ##2 ##s cells assembled with the [UNK] nf ##s as a cathode display two striking features for an initial charge process , [UNK] . , a low initial activation potential of [UNK] v , and a low and stable charge voltage plateau ( [UNK] v ) .
in the beginning of the first charge process , it can be found that the voltage increases quickly to [UNK] v and then decreases , indicating a low activation voltage of only [UNK] v for the [UNK] nf cathode .
also , a stable voltage plateau of [UNK] v last ##s a long charge process , suggesting a stable structure and a uniform li ##2 ##s grain size in the [UNK] nf ##s .
the discharge voltage profile of fe ##3 ##o ##4 @ [UNK] showed a plateau at [UNK] v ( [UNK] li / [UNK] ) in the 1st cycle and shoulder peaks at [UNK] v in the [UNK] cycles , which conc ##urs with the known behavior of the fe ##3 ##o ##4 anode materials ( fig .
however , life ##po ##4 cathodes generally operate at a low voltage ( [UNK] v versus li / li ##þ ) , which results in a low specific energy density of the battery , and they also suffer from inherently low electronic conductivity .
moreover , the cell with the [UNK] / [UNK] catalyst presented much lower voltage polarization ( about [UNK] v at a rate of 50 ma g - ##1 ) than that measured with only mn ##o2 nanorods during charge / discharge processes .
all of the samples have a steep voltage dropping from [UNK] v to about [UNK] v , which can be attributed to the reaction between li ion and the fe ##3 ##o ##4 ( [UNK] li ##x ##fe ##3 ##o ##4 ) 37 , 38 .
as already mentioned , l ##to undergoes a [UNK] transition during charge and discharge , and exhibits therefore a broad voltage plateau at approximately [UNK] v [UNK] li reference electrode in the region f [ 12 ] .
promising results were obtained in the case of lin ##i1 / 3m ##n1 / 3c ##o ##1 / 3 ##o2 which exhibit a better stability at high voltage than lic ##oo ##2 or lin ##io ##2 and a reversible capacity of ~ ##200 [UNK] between [UNK] and [UNK] v [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
during lithiation , the potential shows a plateau at higher voltage position ( [UNK] v ) and that indicates the formation of amorphous li ##2 ##o by the reaction of li ion and the sn ##o2 at the interface of the electrode and electrolyte [ [UNK] ] .

when the discharge voltage reached [UNK] v , [UNK] mos ##2 with a large table 2 reported electrochemical intercalation exfoliation to obtain 1t no .
however , further discharging to [UNK] v led to the fragmentation of the mos ##2 layers and the formation of [UNK] therefore , a careful manipulation of the discharging time or the operating voltage is of great importance for the electrochemical intercalation exfoliation approach to avoid the decomposition of mos ##2 .

durability tests with voltage sweeps between [UNK] and [UNK] v vs ag / ag ##cl in k ##oh showed good durability for [UNK] cycles , whereas voltage sweeps between [UNK] and [UNK] v vs li / [UNK] in [UNK] yielded significant degradation after 1000 cycles .
s ##6 ##a , during the first cathodic process within the [UNK] voltage of [UNK] v , two reduction peaks located at [UNK] and [UNK] v emerge , followed by an obvious peak at [UNK] v , corresponding to na ##þ ions intercalation into cos ##e2 and subsequently conversion reaction , respectively .

however , they have a low theoretical spec ##ic capacity ( 372 ma ##h g 1 ) and safety hazards arising from their low operating voltage ( below [UNK] v [UNK] [UNK] / li ) . ##7 both m ##x ##oy and lithium alloys deliver higher spec ##ic capacities than those of carbonaceous [UNK] in particular , iron oxides ( fe ##x ##oy ) , such as fe ##2 ##o ##3 and fe ##3 ##o ##4 , are one of the most appealing candidates because of their much higher theoretical spec ##ic capacity ( [UNK] ma ##h g 1 ) , widespread availability , environmental benign ##ancy and enhanced [UNK] unfortunately , similar to all other m ##x ##oy , the low electronic conductivity and drastic mechanical degradation owing to the huge volume changes ##14 during cycling lead to poor rate capability characteristics and fast capacity fading , which this journal is © the ro ##ya ##l society of chemistry 2014 pu bl is he d on 2 8 a pr il 20 14 .

and the discharge capacity of the pure sn ##o2 dn ##cs electrode in the 2nd cycle is [UNK] ma h g 1 , corresponding to [UNK] % retention of its initial discharge capacity .
in fact , the terminal charge voltage for life ##po ##4 batteries is usually limited to [UNK] v ; this corresponds to a life ##po ##4 potential of around [UNK] v [UNK] li / [UNK] , since the negative electrode accounts for approximately [UNK] v [UNK] li / [UNK] .
lim ##n ##po ##4 is a much more ro ##mis ##ing cathode material for [UNK] batteries than life ##po ##4 ec ##ause of its higher redox voltage of [UNK] v versus li / [UNK] .

another spinel structured cathode material , [UNK] , has been studied due to its significant reversible capacity at the high voltage of [UNK] v versus li / [UNK] .
in the first discharge step , the three curves show a long voltage plateau at approximately [UNK] v , which is typical for magnetite fe ##3 ##o ##4 .
the steep voltage slope between 2 and [UNK] v is ascribed to [UNK] insertion into the fe ##3 ##o ##4 lattice to form li ##x ##fe ##3 ##o ##4 , and the long potential plateau at roughly [UNK] v corresponds to the reversible reduction of [UNK] / [UNK] to fe ##0 .
in the second cycle , the discharge plateau of the porous g ##n @ c / fe ##3 ##o ##4 sample increases to a slightly higher voltage ( [UNK] v ) and becomes much shorter , further indicating the occurrence of irreversible reactions during the first cycle .
electrochemical results demonstrate that the tin ##b2 ##o ##7 could deliver an average reversible capacity as high as [UNK] and [UNK] ma h [UNK] at charge / discharge rates of 20 ##c and 50 ##c , respectively , indicating that 1d tin ##b2 ##o ##7 could be a promising candidate for lib ##s with [UNK] capability .
when the rate was returned to 1 c , the average charge capacity recovered to [UNK] ma h [UNK] , which is nearly the same as the initial charge capacity of [UNK] ma h [UNK] at 1 c , indicating the superior electrochemical reversibility of the tin ##b2 ##o ##7 electrode .

the reported reaction mechanisms of the lm ##ro cathode materials include : ( 1 ) mechanism of oxygen release ; ( 2 ) mechanism of surface reaction ; ( 3 ) mechanism of peroxide reaction and ( 4 ) mechanism of proton [UNK] the high initial irreversible capacity of the lm ##ro cathode materials mainly originate from the activation of the li ##2 ##mn ##o ##3 component at high voltages over [UNK] v , which causes the discharge capacity to decrease by [UNK] % that of the charge [UNK] the side reaction of the interphase between the cathode surface and the electrolyte , especially at high cutoff charge voltages over [UNK] v , is another reason leading to its initial irreversible [UNK] it is generally accepted that the phase transformation from layered to spinel structure occurs when the lm ##ro cathodes are charged to [UNK] [UNK] the gradual growth of the spinel phase results in voltage fading and capacity decay during [UNK] the dissolution of metal elements in the electrolyte also gives rise to capacity / voltage [UNK] the low conductivity of lim ##o2 and li ##2 ##mn ##o ##3 oxides is one of the main reasons causing the poor rate capability of the lm ##ro cathode [UNK] it has also been reported that the activity of the li ##2 ##mn ##o ##3 phase could damage the electrode surface structure which increases its interfacial impedance and decreases the [UNK] ions ' diffusion kinetics , which also severely causes the poor rate capability of the lm ##ro cathode [UNK] representative modification methods including chemical activation , doping / substitution , and surface coating are used to overcome these issues of high initial irreversible capacity , poor cycle life , fast voltage fading , and poor rate capability of the lm ##ro cathode materials .
at a voltage of [UNK] v or higher , the reduction of the mixed xi ##de starts from ni ##o to ni , followed by that of ce ##o2 on the surface of the newly formed ni to form cen ##i ##5 alloy .

unlike the [UNK] electrochemical feature of nico ##2 ##o ##4 @ au nt electrode , the cell voltage ( [UNK] v ) is almost twice that of conventional [UNK] symmetric capacitors in aqueous electrolytes ( about [UNK] v ) .
[ 17 ] also reported that the improved [UNK] tro ##chemical performance of [UNK] lic ##oo ##2 in the higher voltage region of [UNK] v was not due to structural changes of host structure but rather the stabilization of interface between cathode and electrolyte .
in addition to a variety of [UNK] composites that are being investigated as high performance anodes for si ##bs , metal phosph ##ide systems ( mp ##x , m = sn , se , fe , co , cu , and ni ) also present high reversible capacity , improved cycling stability , and good rate [UNK] for instance , sn ##4 ##p3 , which was examined as an anode material for si ##bs for the first time by ki ##m et al . , can alloy with [UNK] to form na ##15 ##s ##n ##4 and na ##3 ##p during so ##di ##ation , corresponding to the theoretical gravimetric capacity of 113 ##2 ma h g 1 and the high theoretical volumetric capacity of 66 ##50 ma h cm 3 ( [UNK] 57 ##10 ma h cm 3 for bare p ) , along with a high electrical conductivity of [UNK] s cm 1 ( [UNK] [UNK] 10 5 s cm 1 for p / carbon ) . ##12 ##9 moreover , the sn ##4 ##p3 electrode presented a lower redox potential of about [UNK] v compared to that for bare p ( [UNK] v ) , suggesting that sn ##4 ##p3 as an anode material could contribute to higher energy density in the full cell .
at the optimized [UNK] voltage ( [UNK] v ) for preparing nico ##2 ##o ##4 , the [UNK] [UNK] batteries demonstrated an initial capacity of 29 280 ma h g 1 and retained a stable capacity of 410 ##00 ma h g 1 after 100 full cell cycles .
developed [UNK] nico ##2 ##o ##4 anchored to a ni [UNK] after discharging at a current density of 40 ma g 1 , the [UNK] battery fabricated with this cathode delivered 700 ##4 ma h g 1 with a charging voltage lower than [UNK] v ( capacity based on nico ##2 ##o ##4 mass ) .
during this process , fresh surface was exposed upon electrochemical charge by releasing li ##x ##mo ##o ##3 into the electrolyte , inducing at the low charging voltage below [UNK] v at 100 ma cm 2 .
another promising cathode material like li ##2 ##cop ##o ##4f has been also studied due to its capacity and high discharge voltage close to [UNK] v vs [UNK] / li [ 5 ] .

it can be inferred from these single cell characteristics that the useful working voltage for negative activated carbon electrode is [UNK] v while that for the positive nan ##ip ##o ##4 electrode it is [UNK] v , resulting in a potential of [UNK] v for a full cell system .
as a dominant cathode material used in commercial lib ##s , lic ##oo ##2 can deliver a capacity of ~ ##140 ma h g 1 by de ##inter ##cal ##ating 1 / 2 li ##þ ions at the average voltage of [UNK] v [ 18 ] .
the electrochemical performances showed that the introduction of li ##2 ##mn ##o ##3 greatly improved the reversible specific capacity and interface stability under high cutoff voltage operation ( [UNK] v ) compared to pristine nan ##i1 / 3c ##o ##1 / 3m ##n1 / 3 ##o2 .
the initial coulombic efficiency of fe ##s ##bo ##4 was [UNK] % for 200 ma g - ##1 and [UNK] % for 50 ma g - ##1 , and the corresponding values were [UNK] % and [UNK] % for fe ##s ##bo ##4 / c .
the [UNK] electrode displays a stable capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 after 50 cycles with a capacity loss of [UNK] % per cycle .
in stage і , the plateau at higher voltage ( around [UNK] v ) is observed and is attributed to the insertion of [UNK] into sn ##s2 layers [ 1 ] .
when the current density reaches 800 ma g 1 , the [UNK] electrode can still retain a discharge capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 .
the second step ( plateau at [UNK] v ) is the formation of bif ##3 from bi ; the plateau voltage is in agreement with the theoretical electrom ##otive force of the bi / bif ##3 redox couple [UNK] ce / ce ##f ##3 ( [UNK] v ) .
the voltage plateaus at [UNK] v and [UNK] v were associated with [UNK] ion insertion / de ##ins ##ert ##ion in the na ##2 ##ti ##3 ##o ##7 structure , and the low plateaus at [UNK] v and [UNK] v might have been caused by [UNK] ion insertion / de ##ins ##ert ##ion in carbon black .
in addition , the early reduction of [UNK] to [UNK] at a voltage of [UNK] v when the [UNK] ions were inserted into tunnel na ##2 ##ti ##6 ##o ##13 may have contributed to increasing the electronic conductivity of the whole [UNK] electrode , which in turn contributed to increasing its rate performance [ [UNK] ] .
in addition , as the tunnel na ##2 ##ti ##6 ##o ##13 content increased in the [UNK] hybrids , the loss of voltage plateaus at [UNK] v occurred at lower current densities .
during the solid ##ation processes , the + ##d ##na values under the high voltage regime ( [UNK] v to [UNK] v ) , which corresponds to [UNK] ion insertion in tunnel na ##2 ##ti ##6 ##o ##13 , did not change significantly .

all three sa ##m ##les exhibit a flat voltage plateau around [UNK] v ( versus [UNK] / li ) , es ##ulting from the [UNK] redox reactions between fe ##po ##4 nd l ##fp ##o .
it can be clearly seen that both materials show a [UNK] voltage plateau at approximately [UNK] v at low rates and the specific capacity of l ##to ##cp ##tl ( 3 wt % ) exhibits much higher than that of l ##to at all rates .
for example , limiting the reaction voltage of ins ##b and ag ##3 ##s ##b to the [UNK] / [UNK] stage ( to > [UNK] v for ins ##b and > [UNK] v for ag ##3 ##s ##b ) significantly improved the reversible reaction [ [UNK] ] .

nevertheless , few researchers have extended the discharge voltage of [UNK] l ##to to [UNK] v or near 0 v to increase its discharge rate and capacity [ [UNK] ] .
even at a high current density of 1000 ma g - ##1 , the specific capacity remained at about 240 ma h [UNK] , whereas that of sn ##s2 np ##s and sn ##s2 / [UNK] dropped to only [UNK] ma h g - ##1 .

in the first cycle , the discharge / charge capacity is [UNK] / [UNK] g 1 , corresponding to a super ##hi ##gh initial coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % , implying the high reversibility of z ##ns ##e np @ n ##h ##c electrode in the [UNK] electrolyte , which is important and beneficial for the future commercial applications .
as the external temperature rises , [UNK] has stable high discharge capacities and maintains [UNK] ma h [UNK] even at 70 ° ##c which is very close to the initial discharge capacity at room temperature .
furthermore , a specific capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 , attributed to the li ##z ##n alloy formation and deallo ##ying , is also observed for z ##n .

thus , [UNK] electrolytes are ideal partners for the [UNK] battery system because li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 is usually operated above [UNK] v and a high operation potential cathode is required for combination with li ##4 ##ti ##5 ##o ##12 to obtain a high voltage output .

the initial coulombic efficiency of [UNK] [UNK] composite was [UNK] % , which could be largely due to the lithium ion assumption in the ni ##o reduction reaction and electrolyte decomposition and formation of solid electrolyte interface ( se ##i ) film on graphene and ni ##o nanosheets .
gu ##o et [UNK] reported liv ##3 ##o ##8 with an initial capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 at 300 ma g 1 ; however , the capacity fade ##d to [UNK] ma h g 1 rapidly during the rs ##t 50 cycles .

from the electrochemical open circuit voltage of [UNK] v for a li / life ##po ##4 cell containing [UNK] material , one can calculate the free energy of formation of life ##po ##4 to be [UNK] kj / mol .
a recent publication pointed out that the redox potentials of li ##2 ##mn ##p2 ##o ##7 may exist above [UNK] v , 29 which is thus not observable within the voltage range ( [UNK] to [UNK] v ) of this work .
it is noted that in the first discharge curve , at [UNK] v and [UNK] v there appeared two voltage plateaus , although not very apparent , indicating the formation of the se ##i and the reduction of lithium to carbon and mn ##3 ##o ##4 .
here , we report layered nav ##opo ##4 as a cathode material that exhibits high voltage ( [UNK] v versus na / [UNK] ) , high discharge capacity ( 144 ma ##h g 1 at [UNK] c ) , and remarkable cycl ##ability with 67 % capacity retention over [UNK] cycles .
the [UNK] electrode is able to maintain a reversible capacity as high as [UNK] ma h g 1 at 2c aer 300 cycles while retaining nearly 100 % coulombic efficiency .
compared with mn ##o2 , mn ##oo ##h possesses higher initial coulombic efficiency ( [UNK] % ) and better rate performance ( [UNK] ma h g 1 at a current density of 2000 ma g 1 ) .
mn ##oo ##h can deliver an initial discharge capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 and charge capacity of [UNK] ma h g 1 at a current density of 80 ma g 1 with a coulombic efficiency of [UNK] % .
